/**
 * Screenshot harness for the Crew Members DM header pill's ACTIVITY LINE: the
 * one line under the crewmate's name that says what it is doing right now
 * (`pages/members/pillActivity.ts`). Against a REAL pod, not fixtures.
 *
 * What the evidence has to show, per frame:
 *   - resting: the line is present and reads "Idle · <time ago>" — text only,
 *     no dot or glyph, and the pill is the same height it will be while busy;
 *   - a live turn: the line follows the slot's shared status (`toolStatusLabel`
 *     over `slotStatusDetail`) — "Thinking…" while the model reasons, the tool
 *     call's own purpose while a tool runs (simplified tool names on), the
 *     streaming copy once output flows — and a long purpose is cut at the cap
 *     with one ellipsis;
 *   - the line is not part of the button's accessible name.
 *
 * The live frames need the pod to actually run a turn, so the harness sends
 * one message through the real composer. A live turn moves faster than a
 * screenshot: photographing "whenever the attribute changes" produced frames
 * whose pixels showed the NEXT state (the UX lane caught a "tool" frame that
 * read "Thinking…"). So the socket is stepped: the dashboard's WebSocket is
 * routed through Playwright and, during the turn, server frames are released
 * to the page ONE AT A TIME; when a frame lands the pill in a state not yet
 * photographed, the release pauses, the frame is shot, and the pill is
 * re-read AFTER the shot to prove it still shows the same state. Real
 * backend frames, real UI -- only their pacing is controlled. A state the
 * turn never reaches is reported, not faked.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   kirocrew pod up <worktree> --json | tail -1 > "$KIROCREW_SCRATCH/pod-info.json"
 *   POD_INFO="$KIROCREW_SCRATCH/pod-info.json" \
 *     node scripts/capture-members-pill-activity.mjs ../temp-screenshots/members-pill-activity
