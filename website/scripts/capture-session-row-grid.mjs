/**
 * Screenshot harness for the session row's 4px type scale.
 *
 * The change is pure geometry, so the evidence has to be geometry: this harness
 * measures the RENDERED boxes in a real browser (jsdom has no layout engine, so
 * the unit test can only assert the classes that ask for them) and fails loudly
 * if a row is not a whole number of grid units, or if the status marker does not
 * sit on the line it leads — and, since the marker moved out of the row's left
 * pad, if it starts inside the band the recency tint paints there.
 *
 * Two rows exist to catch what a plain row cannot: a very long title, which used
 * to wrap to two lines and change the row's height, and a row carrying PR chips,
 * which is ~18px taller than the rest — the case that row-centring the marker got
 * wrong when it lived in an absolute gutter.
 *
 * This is the ONE place the row's geometry is measured. It prints the per-edge
 * audit (every line box's top and bottom, plus the row-to-row PITCH — the term
 * that caught a 60/61px alternation no row height could have revealed), asserts
 * the invariants, and captures the shots. An earlier revision split the reporting
 * half into its own script; two harnesses stubbing the same API and measuring the
 * same boxes drift apart, and only one of them would get updated.
 *
 * Runs the REAL built SPA (website/dist) behind the shared loopback static server
 * with every /api/** call answered from fixtures (gateway-free).
 *
 * Set GRID_BASELINE=1 to capture the BEFORE state instead: the geometry checks
 * become reports (the baseline fails them, which is the point) and the shots are
 * written as `00-BEFORE-*`. That is how the before/after pair in the PR body is
 * produced from ONE harness, so the two sides cannot drift apart.
 *
