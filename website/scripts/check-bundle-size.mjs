// Usage:
//   vite build --mode analyze && node scripts/check-bundle-size.mjs
//   node scripts/check-bundle-size.mjs [path/to/bundle-report.json]
//
// The global `chunkSizeWarningLimit` in vite.config.ts is one ceiling for every
// chunk, sized to the largest known-large chunk -- so it cannot tell
// "known-large" from "newly oversized": any NEW chunk up to that ceiling is
// admitted silently. This gate closes that gap with explicit per-chunk budgets:
// the chunks that are irreducibly large today are allowlisted at ceilings just
// above their measured size, and every other chunk gets a 500 KB default. A
// chunk over its budget fails the build with one actionable line per breach.
//
// Reads the `dist/bundle-report.json` that the `kirocrew-bundle-report` plugin
// emits in analyze mode (see vite.config.ts), so a normal `npm run build` stays
// byte-for-byte unaffected -- CI runs the analyze build and then this script.

  // `t()` no longer pull the other twelve catalogs in behind them. Sized for the
  // English catalog plus headroom; a jump here means a non-English catalog, or a
  // library, reached the runtime module.
  // Re-measured 2026-09-04 at 740 KB, and the 702 KB note above was ~38 KB
  // stale, which is the same recurrence it describes: main drifted to EXACTLY
  // 740.00 KB (757,764 B, 4 B over its own ceiling), so the gate began failing
  // on the merge ref of every open PR rather than on the new library or surface
  // it exists to catch. Attribution was measured, not assumed -- the branch that
  // tripped it first builds a BYTE-IDENTICAL `t` chunk to its own base
  // (`t-BLZeayKy.js`, 755,868 B on both), and main's tip alone, with none of that
  // branch's code, reproduces the 4-byte failure with the same content hash. So
  // the growth is main's accumulated English strings, and headroom is what was
  // actually missing. 5% headroom, matching the file-wide convention,
  // so the next English string does not re-trip this for the third time.
  // Re-measured 2026-09-08: main @ 9af9543b0 alone builds the chunk at
  // 795,127 B (776.5 KB) against the 777 KB ceiling -- 0.07% headroom, the
  // same drift again (~36 KB of English strings in four days). A feature PR
  // adding ~40 keys (#8307) trips it on its merge ref while main's own gate
  // stays green, so the ceiling moves back to the 5% convention.
  // Two catalog surfaces stack on this chunk after the merge: the
  // structured-monitor dashboard (57 English keys) and the managed-credentials
  // surface (25 English keys plus setup / irreversibility guidance). Both are
  // ordinary translated product copy, not a library reaching the runtime. The
  // merged analyze build measures the chunk at 807,525 B (788.6 KB); keep
  // roughly 5% headroom (the file-wide convention) over that
  // combined measurement so expected catalog growth does not block descendants.
  // Re-measured 2026-09-13 on the reviewed member capability inheritance
  // branch rebased onto main @ f382f0a70: the analyze build emits the chunk at
  // 839,943 B (820.3 KB) against the 819 KB ceiling -- 1,287 B over. The
  // growth is English catalog copy only: the feature's 96 keys
  // (`crewCapabilities` / `crewCapabilityEditing`, ~4.7 KB) plus 15 upstream
  // keys that landed on main after the branch's previous rebase. The chunk
  // report counts 12 modules; this PR adds no dependency. This is the
  // documented catalog-growth drift again: the previous ceiling
  // was set at 3.7% over its own measurement, below the 5% convention, and
  // ordinary catalog growth since then used that margin up. Back to the 5%
  // convention over the measured size.
  // Re-measured 2026-09-19 on this channel-folder backfill branch rebased onto
  // main @ 1c7f963706: main's catalogs ALONE build the chunk at 881,305 B
  // (860.6 KB) against the 861 KB ceiling -- 359 B left, or 0.04% headroom. With
  // this feature's copy it builds at 882,910 B (862.2 KB), 1.2 KB over.
  // Attribution is measured, not assumed: reverting ONLY the 14 files under
  // `website/src/i18n/` to the base and rebuilding drops the chunk to the
  // 881,305 B above, so the delta this branch owns is 1,605 B -- its 18 keys of
  // product copy across 13 catalogs plus the generated `en-XA` pseudo-locale,
  // which roughly doubles the byte cost of every string. The report still counts
  // 12 modules and this branch adds no dependency, and no lazy `import()`
  // boundary can move a catalog string out of this chunk (English
  // is the always-loaded fallback). This is the documented drift for the fourth time: a
  // ceiling left at 0.04% headroom fails on the next feature's ordinary strings
  // rather than on the new library it exists to catch. Back to the 5% convention
  // over the measured size.
  // Re-measured on this branch: with the base catalogs restored and only this
  // branch's other code present, the chunk builds at 926,128 B (904.4 KB), which
  // is 592 B under the 905 KB ceiling -- 0.06% headroom. The judge row's nine
  // keys across the twelve shipped catalogs, plus the generated `en-XA`
  // pseudo-locale that roughly doubles each string's byte cost, add 1,456 B on
  // top, so the build lands at 927,584 B (905.8 KB) -- 607 B over the old 905 KB
  // ceiling. Attribution is measured, not assumed: reverting ONLY the files under
  // `website/src/i18n/` to the base and rebuilding produces the 926,128 B above,
  // and this branch adds no dependency to the chunk. No lazy `import()` boundary
  // can move a catalog string out of it, since English is the always-loaded fallback. This is
  // the drift the notes above already describe: a ceiling left under a tenth of a
  // percent of headroom fails on the next feature's ordinary strings rather than
  // on the new library it exists to catch. Back to the 5% convention over the
  // measured size.
  // OPERATOR-SET CEILING, NOT A MEASUREMENT. It departs from the 5% convention
  // every other entry follows, and it is written this way deliberately so nobody
  // reads it as one.
  //
  // Measured 955.0 KB (977948 B) on an analyze build of main at 2026-09-27, which
  // is 28 B over the 955 KB this entry used to carry -- and that 28 B was failing
  // the gate on EVERY open pull request at once, on a chunk whose growth none of
  // those branches caused. A repository maintainer chose to stop that bill with a
  // wide ceiling rather than by shrinking the chunk or by re-measuring it to ~1003
  // KB, knowing what the choice costs: at 6.4x the measured size this entry no
  // longer signals growth for this chunk, so the next 5 MB of i18n-runtime bloat
  // arrives green. That is accepted for now; what it buys is that the gate stops
  // reporting to people who cannot act on it.
  //
  // So this number is a decision, not evidence, and the thing it defers is still
  // open: the i18n runtime went from a measured ~909 KB to 955 KB and nobody has
  // named what grew. Re-measuring this entry down to the 5% convention is a
  // strict improvement whenever someone does that work -- and until then, reading
  // this ceiling as "the chunk is fine" would be reading it wrong.
  //
  // The crew board adds ~1,610 B (35 keys of product copy across the 12 shipped

  // @ 6ae74179d to 3,440,273 B (3360 KB) against the 3360 KB ceiling -- 367 B
  // of headroom, so a PR adding ONE module to the app core (#9437, +1.7 KB)
  // fails the gate on its merge ref while main itself still passes by a hair.
  // Same recurrence, same remedy: 5% headroom, matching the `t`

  // The managed-credentials UI and its setup / irreversible-delete states take
  // the merge result to 3,445,107 B (3364.4 KB). Preserve the documented margin
  // at that current measurement; a library-class regression still exceeds this
  // ceiling by hundreds of kilobytes.
  // Re-measured 2026-09-21 against main @ 20261b7633, whose tip alone -- no PR
  // code in the tree -- builds this chunk at 3,619,504 B and so exceeds the
  // 3533 KB (3,617,792 B) ceiling by 1,712 B on its own. The margin the lines
  // above describe is therefore already spent: the gate fails on the merge ref
  // of every open PR, which is exactly the recurrence the `t` entry
  // documents, and attribution here was measured rather than assumed (pristine
  // main built in its own worktree, then this branch on top of it).
  // The compaction shadow-scoring surface (the keep line, its record reader and
  // one settings switch) adds 2,761 B of first-party code on top of that, for a
  // merge result of 3,622,265 B. The ceiling moves to cover both parts --
  // main's 1,712 B of drift and this surface's 2,761 B -- rounded up to this
  // table's whole-KB unit: 3538 KB, which leaves 647 B of headroom. It is NOT
  // restored to the ~5% margin the lines above prescribe, because that is a
  // re-measure of main's growth rather than a cost this surface incurs; at 647 B
  // the next app-core addition trips this entry again.
  // Re-measured 2026-09-21 after rebasing onto main @ 17c96c7ab0, which had itself
  // re-baselined this entry to 3538 KB for the compaction shadow-scoring surface
  // (that measurement and its reasoning are the paragraph above; both notes are kept
  // because the two surfaces are independent and the ceiling has to cover both).
  // Attribution measured, not assumed: main's tip alone builds this chunk at
  // 3,622,265 B per the note above, and this branch on top of it builds 3,624,314 B
  // (3539.4 KB). So main's 3538 KB (3,622,912 B) is 1,402 B SHORT of the merge ref of
  // this PR, which is why the entry moves again rather than being left alone.
  // This branch's own cost is the difference, 2,049 B -- and that is the SAME 2,049 B
  // measured against the previous base (main @ feed35446c at 3,616,146 B, this branch
  // at 3,618,195 B), so the attribution is confirmed by two independent bases rather
  // than by one build. It is not a library or a lazy-loadable surface: the member
  // projection store, its hook and the roster/drawer wiring are first-party app-core
  // code with no lazy boundary available, the same shape the notes above document.
  // Back to the ~5% convention over the measurement that includes this branch,
  // matching the `t` entry.
  // The memory-recall strip, its own record reader and the card's second switch
  // add a further 5,492 B on top of that.
  // Route-only pages (settings, capabilities, schedule, artifacts, apps, ...) load
  // through React.lazy in their own chunks, so this chunk holds the shell and the
  // chat route; the ceiling keeps the ~5% margin the lines above prescribe.
  // The composer's compacting state (spinner + "Stop is unavailable" hint), the
  // armed-Stop "click again" hint with its client-side timer
  // (useStopDeclinedHint) and the stop card's declined state add ~2 KB of

  // design, so there is no lazy boundary to put them behind. The chunk had
  // already grown to within 1 KB of the previous ceiling on main.
