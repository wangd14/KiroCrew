/**
 * Screenshot harness for the two surfaces `compaction.keep` adds.
 *
 * Runs the REAL built SPA (website/dist) with every /api/** call answered from
 * fixtures. No gateway, no agent and no Jev call: only the network is stubbed, so
 * `readCompactionKeepRecord`, `CompactionCard`'s three shapes, the transcript
 * virtualizer and the settings card render exactly as in production.
 *
 * Two surfaces, because the feature is a measurement and the consent that allows it:
 *
 *  - the LINE. One line under the compaction notice, saying what an oracle WOULD
 *    have kept. SIX frames per theme, one per shape the record outlives: the
 *    threshold success notice, the recycle notice, the ⚠-led failure that renders
 *    through the shared error surface, the conditional `(+K not scored)` copy, and
 *    the `completed` summary card both COLLAPSED and EXPANDED — that last one is the
 *    only shape with a disclosure, and the line sits outside the fold, so both states
 *    are claims. A line placed inside one branch would be absent from the others, and
 *    only a picture of each shows it is not.
 *
 *    ONE compaction card per frame, and that is the point rather than tidiness. A
 *    transcript carrying all of them photographs the same picture every time,
 *    differing only by scroll offset — so the files' hashes differ while the evidence
 *    does not, and a reader cannot tell which row a frame is about. Each scene serves
 *    its own slot detail (the harness reads `detail` at request time) with its own
 *    record, so the numbers on the line differ frame to frame too.
 *  - the SWITCH. The third consent row on the Decisions (Jev) card, plus the
 *    point row it unlocks. The `withheld` pass serves the SAME fixtures with the
 *    scope revoked and ASSERTS both are absent, because "the row appears" is only
 *    half the claim.
 *
 * The transcript frames are FULL-FRAME rather than clipped to the card. A wrapper-tight
 * crop cuts the notice's own sentence out, and "the line sits under the notice" is the
 * claim — so the frame has to contain both. Every frame also asserts the THEME it is
 * named for: the theme is a stored preference rather than a media query, so a page
 * navigated without a cold load renders in the previous one, and that failure is
 * otherwise silent (two files, one mislabelled, nothing in the run saying so).
 *
 * WHAT THIS HARNESS ASSERTS, and why it asserts anything at all: a capture script
 * that only writes PNGs fails toward a false pass -- a fixture typo, a clipped
 * card or a state that never arrived all still produce a tidy image a PR can cite.
 * So every frame also checks the words that make it that state, and the two
 * absence claims are checked rather than described.
 *
 * Usage: node scripts/capture-decision-compaction-keep.mjs [outDir]
