// A new chat session must NOT be created carrying a model the user did not pick.
//
// A session's model is a permanent pin: the runtime reads `slot.model or
// agent_model`, so once slot.model is set it wins for every later turn. ChatPage
// used to seed `pendingModel` at mount from the backend resolver -- which answers
// "what would run", correct for the composer chip and wrong as a create value --
// so every new chat was pinned to whatever the four-tier chain resolved at page
// load. An agent left on Auto never re-resolved, and later changes to the agent or
// the global default never reached the session (#2035).
//
// Omitting `model` is what preserves the chain: `SessionManager.get_or_create`
// documents that a `None` model falls back to the global `agent.model` config,
// only when the named agent does not pin its own, and stays `None` for a sentinel
// like "auto" so the backend resolves from the agent's own JSON config.
//
// WHY A SOURCE GUARD RATHER THAN A RENDER TEST: the observable contract is the
// absence of a field in the `POST /api/chat/slots` body, and the paths that build
// it (first send, and the empty-state "Start a new chat" button) sit behind a
// ChatPage render harness that mocks ChatInput away -- so the send path is not
// reachable and a render test could not actually observe the payload. This repo
// already uses structural guards for invariants of exactly this shape (see the
// `str()`-coercion guard in test/test_agent_default_model.py and the conftest
// audit in test/test_mcp_gateway_pool_integ.py). The invariant here is "no
// resolver result ever reaches setPendingModel", which is a property of the
// source and is checked exactly.
