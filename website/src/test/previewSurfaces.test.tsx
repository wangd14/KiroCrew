/**
 * Preview-flag gating for unreleased surfaces.

 * The contract under test is "an unpolished surface is not advertised anywhere",

 * the storage primitive, the registry predicate, the Search Everywhere Pages

 * them all. A test that only covered the nav rail would have passed while the
 * palette still shipped a one-keystroke path to the same page.
