/**
 * Guards the native-browser reachability declaration in ChatPage (made by its
 * event-bridge owner, pages/chat/page/eventBridges.ts).
 *
 * The Electron command channel can only deliver a `browser_*` op for a session
 * key it is already polling for (see `listPanelIds` in electron/main.js), and it
 * must poll BEFORE any URL is known. An earlier revision declared only
 * `activeSlot`, which produced two failures seen in a live diagnostic run:
 *
 *   1. a chat created and messaged within seconds RACED the registration — the
 *      navigate reached the gateway first, got `no-native-panel` (503) because no
 *      poller held that key yet, and the proxy fell back to the Playwright mirror
 *      for the whole turn;
 *   2. a BACKGROUND chat was never reachable at all, even when it was the session
 *      the agent was acting for.
 *
 * Declaring a key is not authorization (Browser Mode is), so reporting every open
 * slot costs nothing and removes both.
 *
 * This is a SOURCE-CONTRACT test, matching the existing ChatPage convention (see
 * ChatPage.mcpOAuth.test.tsx): ChatPage's message list is driven by a custom
 * virtualizer that mounts an empty window under jsdom, so a full-page render
 * cannot exercise this effect. The behaviour under test is an IPC side effect of
 * a Redux-derived list, and what regressed before was precisely the source shape
 * — which input the effect reads — so that is what this locks in.
