/**
 * The composer dock floats over the bottom of the transcript scroller (iOS
 * toolbar layout): the scroller runs the full height of the pane and the
 * conversation scrolls UNDER the glass. That only works while the scroller pays
 * for the covered strip, so four things are pinned:
 *
 *  1. The scroller's bottom padding is the dock's MEASURED height plus a fixed
 *     px clearance — never a constant. The dock's height is whatever the status
 *     stack, the follow-up chips, the approval bar and the composer's own growth
 *     add up to, and each of those changes on its own.
 *  2. That measurement comes from a callback ref (commit-phase, so the first
 *     painted frame already carries the right padding) that attaches a
 *     ResizeObserver to the dock root, so later growth re-pads without a frame
 *     where the last line sits under the glass.
 *  3. The clearance and the tail spacer are stated in px, never viewport units.
 *     As `2vh` the clearance tracked the viewport and cut into the last line on
 *     every phone while every desktop viewport looked fine.
 *  4. The welcome hero pads by the same measurement, so it centres in the strip
 *     the dock leaves visible rather than behind it.
 *
 * There is deliberately NO opaque fade band between transcript and dock any
 * more: the material's own blur and tint are what keep the dock legible, and a
 * solid gradient would hide exactly the content the layout exists to show.
 *
 * Asserted against SOURCE TEXT: the wiring spans a constant, a hook and two JSX
 * attributes, and happy-dom has no layout for a ResizeObserver to fire against.
