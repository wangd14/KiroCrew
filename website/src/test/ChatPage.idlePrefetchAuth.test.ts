/**
 * REGRESSION GUARD — an automatic older-history fetch is authorized by a REAL
 * gesture, and that authorization ages out instead of latching.
 *
 * Reported from a phone as "还是有自动 load previous 的问题，然后导致弹跳" — a page
 * of history landing on its own every few seconds, each landing displacing the
 * reader. Frame analysis of a 60fps recording measured one landing as a 108px
 * downward shift of the whole transcript: older rows prepend ABOVE, so a reader
 * sitting at `scrollTop === max` finds max has grown and is suddenly that far
 * from the bottom.
 *
 * What made it self-sustaining: a one-way input latch with a
 * single write and no reset, so one touch of the transcript — which reading a
 * long chat requires — unlocked the automatic doors permanently. A landing's own
 * compensation writes scrollTop, that write fires a `scroll` event, and a quiet
 * timer counts it as activity: land → quiet → land, forever. The authorization
 * is therefore a WINDOW refreshed only by `wheel`/`touchmove`, which our own
 * writes never produce, so it ages out instead of latching.
 *
 * Source-scanned because these gates live in interval bodies and callbacks with
 * no exported seam.
