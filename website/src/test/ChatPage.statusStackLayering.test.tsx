/**
 * The composer dock is one positioned box floating over the bottom of the
 * transcript scroller, and everything in it — the status stack's bars, the queue
 * cards, the composer — is layered by explicit z-indexes. Three things have to
 * stay true for those layers to mean anything, and each is cheap to lose:
 *
 *  1. Neither the dock root nor the status-stack wrapper may form a stacking
 *     context. One z-index on either would be the tempting shortcut that fixes
 *     every child at once — and would also CONFINE SubagentProgressBar's `z-[46]`,
 *     which exists to clear theme-experience overlays rendered OUTSIDE this
 *     subtree. Positioning plus z-index is what creates the context; the dock
 *     root is positioned (it has to float), so its z-index must stay `auto`.
 *  2. QueueStack stays below the composer's own layer: the collapsed front card
 *     carries a -OVERLAP margin so it fuses with the input box, and at or above
 *     the composer's z-index it would surface ON TOP of the box instead.
 *  3. The stack renders exactly the children this file has checked. A sixth bar
 *     lands here first and has to declare its own layer before this goes green.
 *
 * Asserted against SOURCE TEXT: the numbers live in five files, several as
 * Tailwind classes jsdom cannot resolve into a paint order, and the invariant is
 * the comparison BETWEEN them.
