/**
 * The chat hero must not eat the first screen on a phone.
 *
 * A desktop-size heading (`text-5xl`, 48px) squeezed into a narrow row measured
 * 5-6 lines at a 320px viewport in English, German and French. The heading now
 * sits BELOW the brand mark in a column, so it gets the full row width, and it
 * starts at 30px and only grows from `sm`. No 64px counterweight spacer beside
 * the heading exists any more, so none can take a phone's width.
 *
 * happy-dom does no layout, so these pin the declaration: the defect is an
 * unconditional large size or a fixed-width spacer in the heading row, and that
 * is what a source assertion can see.
