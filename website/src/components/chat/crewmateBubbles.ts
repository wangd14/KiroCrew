/**
 * crewmateBubbles — how a crewmate's chat renders (Members page, member-mode
 * slots only; ordinary chats never route through this module).
 *
 * Two rules live here, and ONLY here, so every surface that draws a crewmate's
 * messages (the chat today, a reply thread's footer later) reads the same
 * answer:
 *
 * 1. WHAT SHOWS. A crewmate's chat shows only what the crewmate says to the
 *    user, plus the user's own messages. The machinery a member-mode slot
 *    accumulates — `[auto-nudge cycle N]` turns, `[Cron notification …]` and
 *    `[Subagent completion event]` envelopes, tool-call rows, reasoning
 *    bursts, and the say-nothing rows a quiet patrol ends on — is filtered at
 *    RENDER time by `filterCrewmateChat`. Nothing is deleted: the rows stay in
 *    the slot's transcript and the Work log reads them from there.
 *
 * 2. HOW A RUN LOOKS. Consecutive messages from the crewmate form a run,
 *    Slack-style: one avatar + name + time on the first message, one bubble per
 *    message, grouped corners on the run's (left) side. A run is ONE TURN's
 *    bubbles (RFC screen 05): it breaks on a user message, on any other drawn
 *    row, and at a turn boundary the unfiltered transcript carries (a patrol
 *    wake or an envelope between two replies). `crewmateRunPosition`
 *    stamps each message's place in its run; `crewmateBubbleClass` turns that
 *    into the corner utilities. Right-side corners are always full.
 *
 * Both are pure functions over the transcript so they can be unit-tested and
 * reused by a reply-thread footer without dragging the pane along.
