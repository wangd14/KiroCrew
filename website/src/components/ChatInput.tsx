          Resize is a pure visual enhancement — the textarea already auto-sizes to
          its content and there is no per-pixel keyboard resize gesture — so the
          handle is aria-hidden and carries no interactive semantics.

          Absent under a finger, and its absence is the feature: the reset is a
          double-click, so on touch the gesture could only ever pin the height, never
          undo it. See `manualHeight` for why the persisted value is disregarded
          there too.

          Its 6px box is ALSO the only thing separating the strip above (the
          options row, the tip band) from the composer box — so dropping the
          handle on touch dropped that separation with it, and the options row sat
          flush against the input. Touch therefore keeps the box and drops only
          the affordance, which puts the composer at the same offset under both
          pointer types instead of leaving the gap a side effect of a
          pointer-only control.

          A COLLAPSED composer takes the same branch, for the same reason stated
          the other way round: there is no box left to resize, so the affordance
          would pin a height nobody can see being pinned — while the 6px box is
          still the only thing separating the strip above from the bar that
          replaces the composer. Keep the box, drop the affordance. */}

          animates (exit -> {opacity:0,height:0}); any re-entry cancels that exit
          and snaps straight back to the shown state. An enter that animated from
          {opacity:0,height:0} to height:auto could be interrupted (e.g. an approval
          resolving while the chat tab is backgrounded, so requestAnimationFrame is

          stranding the motion.div at height:0/opacity:0 and hiding the input until
          a remount. Keeping the unmount-while-ghost behavior also means the
          collapsed composer is never a persistently focusable invisible element.

          `composerCollapsed` joins this gate rather than bringing its own

                there and neither does the collapse row. Both need a host on
                touch, and the row cannot simply grow to fit them: with the
                attach label it would be three peer actions, and

                trigger counting as ONE "regardless of how many items it holds".

                to host, and Sketch moves one tap deeper rather than losing its
                place. The row stays at two (label + trigger), and the non-touch
                branch keeps both actions in the "+" menu.

                 review was right that the symmetry argument for it (matching the
                 "+" drop-up) was a preference rather than a constraint.

                 The TRIGGER is deliberately NOT disabled while an upload is in
                 flight, though the pencil it replaces was. The pencil hosted one
                 action, so disabling it disabled exactly that action; this hosts
                 the collapse too, and taking the collapse away mid-upload would
                 reintroduce the unreachability this control exists to fix. The

                previously dead weight — an empty composer on a slot whose last
                turn was cut off. Pressing it hands the thread back to the agent
                instead of sending nothing. The moment the user types a character
                the arrow and the send action come back, so the control never
                carries two meanings at once.

                Labeled, not an icon: this is the only control in the row whose
                action a first-time user cannot infer from its glyph. A bare ▶
                reads as "resume paused media", which is the wrong model — the
                agent is not paused, it is being asked for another turn — and an
                icon-only button puts that correction in a tooltip, which does
                not exist on touch. The word carries it instead, and RotateCw
                replaces Play so the glyph stops promising playback. Widening to
                a pill is deliberate: at 32px round it was pixel-identical to
                Send, so the two most consequential buttons in the composer
                differed only by the symbol inside them.

                The visible text is also the accessible name — no aria-label,
                which would override the label a sighted user reads and break
                WCAG 2.5.3 (Label in Name). `title` carries the longer
                explanation for hover.

          preference persists across reloads, so the trap would too.

          A full-width button rather than a small icon: the whole bar is the
          target, so the gesture back is as cheap as the gesture in, and it cannot
          be missed by someone who does not remember collapsing anything.

          The button's accessible name must stay the ACTION, never the user's own
          draft text. Two independent things hold that and either alone is
          sufficient, which is measured rather than assumed: an explicit name
          (`aria-label`, with `title` as an equivalent fallback) wins over element
          contents, and `aria-hidden` on the draft line empties the contents so
          the fallback has nothing to pick up. Dropping one keeps the name
          correct; dropping BOTH makes the draft the label. Keep both — sighted
          users get the draft, screen-reader users get the button's job, and

              Review's blind reader named this control correctly but rated it "a
              guess, but a confident one" when the bar carried the draft alone: the
              action then lived only in `title`/`aria-label`, so a sighted reader
              had chevrons and grey text to infer from. Naming the action outright
              costs nothing and removes the inference.

              The draft still earns its place next to it -- it answers WHICH
              message is waiting, which is the question someone returning to a
              collapsed composer actually has, and it is the user's own words so it
              needs no translation.

              Both spans are aria-hidden: the button's explicit aria-label already
              names it, and exposing this as content would only duplicate it. */}

          most of the collapse — the assembly gave back 57px with the shelf still
