/**
 * The drag grip on the right edge of a resizable TABLE column's header cell.
 * Pair it with `useTableColumnWidths`, spreading `widths.resizer(key)`:
 *
 *   <TableHead className="w-[68px] relative" style={cols.style('id')}>
 *     {label}
 *     <ColumnResizer column={label} {...cols.resizer('id')} />
 *   </TableHead>
 *
 * The host cell must carry `relative`: the grip is absolutely positioned and
 * resolves against the nearest positioned ancestor, so without it the grip
 * lands on whatever box happens to be positioned further up. It is spelled at
 * the CALL SITE as a literal rather than concatenated in, because
 * `shadcn/require-static-classes` cannot check a className a component builds
 * from an opaque value, and a table's header classes are exactly what that rule
 * exists to keep readable. `SchedulePage.columnContract.test.ts` holds every
 * resizable header to it.
 *
 * A sibling of components/ResizeHandle rather than a variant of it: that one is
 * an in-flow flex child between two panes, this one is absolutely positioned
 * INSIDE the cell it resizes, because a table row has no slot between two
 * cells to put a splitter in. The visual language is shared on purpose (a 6px
 * hit strip carrying a 2px bar, `resize-accent` so a theme can retint it).
 *
 * Unlike the pane grip, every grip in the row shows a faint rule while the
 * pointer is anywhere over the table head: a pane's edge is a place users
 * already try to drag, but nothing about a plain header cell says its boundary
 * moves, and lighting only the hovered cell's rule reads as one decoration
 * rather than as a row of boundaries. It keys off the `thead` ancestor so a
 * caller has no row-level class to remember; a markdown table's grips sit in an
 * overlay outside its `thead`, so they key off the table's header hover too.
 *
 * It is the ARIA window-splitter widget: focusable, arrow-key operable, and it
 * reports its position. Enter and a double-click both return the column to its
 * declared default, so the keyboard can reach every state the mouse can.
