 * Returning to chat retains unfinished input without unmounting the flow.
 * The host receives a typed creation receipt and owns where completion returns.

 * picked, POST /api/crons bound to the crewmate (`member_id`) so the job runs on
 * the crewmate's own memory. The job text is stored as the crewmate's
 * `description` — the roster's "what it is for" field — and repeated in the
 * schedule's message so the crewmate knows what to do on each wake.
 *
 * Completion reports through `onDone`; creation and completed exits update
