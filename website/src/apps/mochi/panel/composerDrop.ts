/**
 * Composer drop/paste ingest — drag files or photos onto the chat box.
 *
 * NOT from the original Mochi: this is the one feature the desktop-buddy fork
 * added that is worth keeping. It lives here rather than inside the vendored
 * ChatPanel so the divergence from upstream stays a handful of lines at the call
 * site, and so the ingest rules are testable without rendering the panel.
 *
 * HOW MANY IMAGES: as many as you like, and this is why the fork's approach was
 * replaced. The fork read one image into base64 and put it in Mochi's single
 * `screenshot` slot, so a second photo was impossible. KiroCrew's own mechanism
 * has no such limit: every dropped image is uploaded, its path rides the send's
 * `meta.images` (the STRUCTURED list the gateway builds one image block per
 * entry from -- the gateway never scans the message text for paths), and the
 * text references it so the sent bubble renders it:
 *
 *   - images       -> `![image](/path.png)`     (markdown, so the sent bubble
 *                                                renders a thumbnail too)
 *   - other files  -> `[attached_file N] /path`
 *
 * Both forms are the dashboard composer's conventions, so the agent reads a
 * Mochi attachment exactly as it reads one from the main chat.
 *
 * A dropped file in a page has no filesystem path — the browser hands over only
 * the bytes — so uploading first is not a choice, it is the only route.
 *
 * The single `screenshot` slot is untouched and still carries the screen-capture
 * (snip) path, which produces base64 without ever touching disk.

/**
 * A base64 screen-capture crop, as a File the upload route accepts.
 *
 * Lives HERE, next to `ingestFiles`, rather than in the panel: ChatPanel imports
 * lucide's `File` ICON, which shadows the DOM `File` constructor for that whole
 * module, so `new File(...)` there constructs a React component and throws
 * "File is not a constructor" at runtime. Keeping the construction in this module
 * — which imports no icons — makes the correct `File` the only one in scope, and
 * the test below pins it. A `globalThis.File` prefix would have worked too, but
 * nothing would stop the next edit from dropping it.
 *
 * The crop arrives as base64 because it crossed a process boundary (the crop
 * window cannot reach the composer). The route keys on the extension, hence the
 * explicit `.png` name and mime — the crop encoder always emits PNG.
