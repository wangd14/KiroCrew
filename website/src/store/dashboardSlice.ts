/** Apply an authoritative slot list, reusing the object identity of every row
 *  whose content is unchanged, and touching `state.slots` only when the list
 *  actually moved.
 *
 *  Membership AND order come from `next` — the server is authoritative on both.
 *  Only per-row identity is carried across, and only for a structurally equal
 *  row, so no consumer can read stale content off a reused reference. The
 *  comparison uses the shared `jsonEqual`, whose key-order independence and
 *  field-agnosticism this relies on: a row may have been patched in place by
 *  `touchSlotActivity` / `updateSlot` / `patchSlotLink` since it was stored (so
 *  its key order can differ from the payload's), and a comparator that listed
 *  `ChatSlot`'s fields would stop seeing a newly added one and pin a stale row
 *  on screen — a correctness bug, where an extra re-render is only a cost.
 *
 *  Identity is load-bearing here rather than a micro-optimisation. The sidebar
 *  renders every row as a Framer `motion.div` with `layout="position"` inside one
 *  `LayoutGroup`, and every selector over `dashboard.slots` invalidates when the
 *  array or any row changes reference. Assigning the incoming array wholesale
 *  hands every row a new reference on every frame, so one slot's status change
 *  re-renders and re-measures the entire list — which reads as the sidebar
 *  reloading rather than as one session becoming active. Slot pushes coalesce at
 *  200ms server-side, so a single active turn delivers several full lists per
 *  second and the effect is continuous.
 *
 *  Skipping the assignment (rather than assigning an equal array) is the half
 *  that matters most: it leaves the array reference alone, which lets a
 *  downstream `useMemo` skip its filter and sort entirely instead of recomputing
 *  an equal result.
 *
 *  Membership has ONE exception: a key in `closingSlots`. `deleteSlot` removes
 *  the row before its DELETE round-trips, but the server keeps the slot in its
 *  registry across several awaits (nudge-loop retirement, the app hook, the
 *  history save) before popping it, and slot pushes coalesce on a 200 ms window
 *  that re-serializes at delivery time — so a frame listing the closing slot as
 *  live is ordinary, not rare, and an HTTP `/api/chat/slots` reply can predate
 *  the click outright. Taking membership at face value put the row back, and
 *  the first post-pop frame removed it again: the disappear / reappear /
 *  disappear flicker of #11224. A closing key is held out of `slots` for the
 *  life of the tombstone. Everything else about the frame — the other rows, the
 *  generation bump, the unread drain — still applies, so the hold never delays
 *  anything but the one row being dismissed.
 *
 *  A list that OMITS the key does not release the hold. It would be tempting to
 *  read that as the server's confirmation, but the two authoritative writers
 *  are not ordered with each other: an HTTP `/api/chat/slots` reply can be
 *  older than the live frames that arrived while it travelled (see
 *  `fetchSlots.fulfilled`), so a post-pop frame that omitted the key could
 *  release the hold and a pre-pop reply still in flight would then re-add the
 *  row. The tombstone is instead retired by the close's OWN lifecycle: while
 *  the DELETE is in flight it holds unconditionally, and once the server has
 *  answered it survives a small, fixed budget of further authoritative lists
 *  (listing the key or not — a straggler can only be that far behind) and then
 *  yields to membership. A server that keeps listing a slot it claims to have
 *  closed is a server bug, and hiding its row indefinitely would turn that bug
 *  into a session the user can no longer see; the budget bounds that too.
 *
 *  "The request bounds it" needs one caveat: `deleteChatSlot` carries no
 *  deadline, so a DELETE stalled server-side (the app hook or the history save
 *  hanging on exactly the long-context session that made the close slow) would
 *  otherwise hold the row hidden until a reload. The in-flight hold therefore
 *  also expires on the wall clock: past `CLOSE_IN_FLIGHT_MAX_MS` the next
 *  authoritative list applies as-is, so a frame that still lists the key shows
 *  it again. That is the pre-fix behaviour — a row that visibly came back —
 *  which is the right failure mode for a close that has not been confirmed in
 *  that long. The confirmed phase has the same cap (`CLOSE_CONFIRMED_MAX_MS`)
 *  for the same reason: `chatSlots()` carries no deadline either, so a
 *  `fetchSlots` snapshotted into `awaitingFetches` that never settles must not
 *  pin the tombstone until a reload. Unlike the in-flight case, though, the
 *  server HAS confirmed this close, so a reply from one of those fetches that
 *  finally lands is known to be pre-pop for THAT key: the pairing is recorded
 *  in `staleSlotFetches` at expiry and the key is filtered out of the reply on
 *  arrival (see `fetchSlots.fulfilled`) instead of resurrecting the row, while
 *  the rest of the reply still applies. */
