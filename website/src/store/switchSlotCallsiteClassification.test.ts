/**
 * Call-site classification ratchet for `dispatch(switchSlot(...))` (#6372).
 *
 * Every non-test dispatch site belongs to exactly one class:
 *
 * - ANNOUNCED (`announceOnMissing: true`) — a user-facing gesture on a listed
 *   session reference. A 404 there surfaces the pane ErrorNotice and the
 *   guarded eviction instead of the silent bounce #6372 reports.
 * - KEEP-TARGET (`keepTargetOnMissing: true`) — a caller that just CREATED the
 *   target; its 404 is a create/fetch race on a slot that exists.
 * - PLAIN — a programmatic or self-handling path (deep-link restore, panel
 *   bind, just-created slots, awaited flows with their own error handling).
 *   Silence there is deliberate: these are not gestures on a LISTED session,
 *   or they recover on their own.
 *
 * The table below pins the per-file counts. Adding a `dispatch(switchSlot(`
 * site fails this test until the new site is classified here — that is the
 * point: the classification must be a decision, never a default. When the new
 * site is a user gesture on a session reference, pass `announceOnMissing`;
 * when it self-handles, bump the plain count AND extend the file's reason.
