 * `clientTs ?? ts`, so without this the row's key flips bornKey -> serverTs"),
 * so this helper matches the store's own keying convention rather than
 * inventing a second, conflicting one.
 *
 * Checking `mid` first would break that: a reconnect refresh preserves
 * `clientTs` but ADDS a server `mid`, so the same row would re-key mid-flight and
 * a byte-identical footer would read as a fresh offer. `mid` and `ts` remain as fallbacks for rows that never carried a
 * client stamp; the index fallback is a last resort for fixture-grade rows, and

/**
 * Derive the follow-up `[OPTIONS:]` buttons for the current chat by scanning
 * backward for the most recent real assistant turn.
 *
 * Three messages short-circuit the scan:
 *  - a `user` message ends the previous turn, so its options no longer apply →
 *    return none. UNLESS the turn it began failed: see `sawError` below.
 *  - a `queued` message means the user already acted (Quick Send while the
 *    slot was busy). The optimistic user bubble was suppressed, but the intent
 *    is identical — hide options immediately so they don't linger until the
 *    queue drains. This stop is UNCONDITIONAL: no failed-turn exception.
 *  - a `stop_event` card is an UNCONDITIONAL stop too. A deliberate Stop ends
 *    the turn rather than interrupting it, so the question is closed by the
 *    user's own cancellation and no error may license reaching back past it.
 *  - a `compaction` notice is skipped. Auto-compaction appends a
 *    "✅ Conversation compacted" message with the `assistant` role but tagged
 *    `kind="compaction"` (see `chat_utils._broadcast_compaction_result`). It
 *    carries no `[OPTIONS:]` marker, so without this skip it would shadow the
 *    real options-bearing turn it follows and the buttons would vanish after a
 *    compaction. The marker is read from `kind` (live websocket path) or
 *    `meta.kind` (history-reload path).
 *
 * A `user`/`queued` row is only a valid stop because it means "the user has
 * answered, so the question is closed". A `user` row whose turn FAILED answered
 * nothing — the question is still open and the choices still apply — but the
 * row stays in the feed forever, so an unconditional stop hid the pills
 * permanently and the user had to retype the choice by hand. `sawError` tracks
 * an error row seen while scanning backward and lets exactly ONE such row be
 * crossed, re-arming per error so repeated failed attempts each get crossed.
 * A `queued` row is NEVER crossed: unlike a `user` row it leaves a live entry
 * in `slot._queue`, which only a hard kill clears, so the choice still runs
 * when the queue drains — re-offering the pill would run it a second time.
 * `error` is the role to key on, but NOT on its own: the backend reaches the feed
 * with role `error` for a terminal failure AND for an auto-retry notice whose
 * recovery is already queued, so only a row without `TRANSIENT_RETRY_KIND` may
 * license a crossing — otherwise the pill re-runs a choice already re-running.
 * A failed turn can also flush the text it streamed as a real assistant row
 * before the error, so an option-less assistant row under a live `sawError` is
 * crossed too — otherwise a partial answer shadows the question that is still
 * open. The trade is deliberate: nothing on the row marks it partial rather
 * than complete, so an error arriving after a genuinely finished option-less
 * reply reads the same way and can re-offer the previous turn's choices.
 *
 * `questionPending` suppresses the pills while an `ask_question` card is on
 * screen for the same slot, so the user is never offered the same choice twice
 * in two different widgets. The card wins because it is the one holding the
 * agent: it blocks a tool call, whereas the pills only compose a next message.
 * Clicking a pill against a blocked turn queues text that turn can never
 * consume, leaving the user waiting on an answer the agent never receives.
 * Callers that never render a card pass nothing — suppressing pills there would
 * leave that surface with no way to answer at all.
