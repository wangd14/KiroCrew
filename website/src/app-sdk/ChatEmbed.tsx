/**
 * ChatEmbed — embeddable chat widget using KiroCrew's native rendering.
 *
 * Uses ChatMessageList (shared with ChatPage) for message rendering.
 * Manages its own state via useAppApi() + React Query. No Redux dependency.
 *
 * State management: polling via useQuery refetchInterval.
 * Poll faster during streaming (1s), slower when idle (5s).
 *
 * The poll is BOUNDED (chat-core P5-e): it asks the slot-detail endpoint for
 * the newest `EMBED_PAGE_LIMIT` rows, and the transcript's "load earlier" bar
 * widens that window by a page per press, up to the handler's own ceiling. An
 * unbounded poll re-read a whole 10 MB thread every second while it ran; the
 * rows are virtualized too, so the DOM cost no longer grows with history
 * either. Incremental (since-cursor) polling is the recorded follow-up.
