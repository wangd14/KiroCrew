/** Names that appear where a session id is expected but are not sessions.
 *
 *  The orphan sweep always spares them: it is *guessing* which names are dead,
 *  and a non-session name looks dead forever. An explicit per-session delete is
 *  different — the caller named its target — so it is honoured unless the key is
 *  shared state that target does not own. That is the whole difference between
 *  the two entries below, and it turns on ownership, not on convenience.
 *
 *  Each name must stay byte-identical to its writer; a divergence collects the
 *  parked value silently.
 *
 *  - `artifacts-gallery` — the virtualizer partitions its height cache by
 *    `sessionId`, and the gallery is not a chat session but still has to name a
 *    partition. Writer: `ARTIFACT_HEIGHT_NS` in `pages/ArtifactsPage.tsx`.
 *    Reserved under every prefix, and the partition IS owned by this name, so an
 *    explicit delete of it is honoured.
 *  - `no-slot` — slot-less consumers park a per-slot preference here. Writer:
 *    `busySendModeKey` in `components/BusySendButton.tsx`. Reserved under that
 *    one prefix so a real slot spelled the same still loses everything else it
 *    owns, and spared even on an explicit delete because the parked value is
 *    shared state belonging to the slot-less case rather than to any slot.
 *
 *  Residual: a slot named exactly like a reserved name is indistinguishable from
 *  the reserved value under a shared prefix. */
