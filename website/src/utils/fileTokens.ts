 *   - A token alone on its line -> standalone upload, stripped from the text and

 * Path resolution is LOSSLESS: the token's number N is the 1-based index into

 * spaces (the serialized `[attached_file N] path` form is not whitespace-
 * delimited) AND even when earlier attachments are images (N indexes the

 * here at all are NOT emitted — a message split into multiple segments (paste
 * tokens) would otherwise re-emit every unreferenced attachment in every
 * segment. The caller renders truly-unreferenced attachments exactly once at
 * message level via findUnreferencedAttachments.
 *
 * `orderedFiles` is the ORIGINAL ordered attachment list (as persisted / as
 * `meta.files`, IMAGES INCLUDED) so token indices line up. Images are filtered
 * out of `cardPaths` on OUTPUT only (they render as inline `![image]()`

 * FALLBACK inverse of prepareSendPayload's attachment serialization, for

 *
 * The PRIMARY restore path is ChatPage's send-side stash: `send()` records
 * the pre-serialization composer state ({typed text, staged files}) keyed by
 * the exact queued content, and `handleCancelQueued` restores from it
 * losslessly for every path shape. This parser covers the cases the stash
 * cannot — a reload, another tab, or a queue entry edited after send — and
 * its contract is strict: claim ONLY what is provably lossless, leave
 * everything else verbatim (never worse than the verbatim restore the base
 * behavior was).
 *
 * Provably lossless claims, and nothing more:
 *  - The producer's LEADING image block — `![image](dest)` lines at the very
 *    start of the content, one per line, ending at the `\n\n` paragraph
 *    break `prepareSendPayload` joins with (or at end of content). Claimed
 *    all-or-nothing: every line must recover an absolute image path, since
 *    the producer never emits anything else there. mdImageDest's `<…>` wrap
 *    makes each destination boundary exact, spaces included. An own-line
 *    image ANYWHERE ELSE is the user's own markdown and stays verbatim —
 *    position alone distinguishes producer output from user content.
 *  - An own-line `[attached_file N] <token>` whose remainder is a single
 *    whitespace-free token, with N ≥ 1 (the producer indexes from 1) and N
 *    unclaimed (the producer emits each index once) and the path absolute.
 *    Both possible readings — whole-line path vs path-plus-prose — are
 *    identical for this shape, so stripping the line and re-staging the path
 *    cannot corrupt either. The line vanishes; the path re-stages.
 *
 * Deliberately left VERBATIM, because their path boundary is not provable
 * from the wire text alone (any whitespace-bounded capture can truncate a
 * spaced path, staging a nonexistent file and re-sending the wrong one):
 *  - embedded (@-mention) markers sitting inline in prose;
 *  - own-line markers whose remainder contains whitespace — equally a spaced
 *    bare-upload path and a line-start mention followed by prose;
 *  - `[attached_dir N]` markers (always inline in prose);
 *  - marker-shaped text with relative paths, N ≤ 0, or duplicate N.
 * Claims are held in a list, never an N-indexed array, so malformed marker
 * text cannot build a sparse structure that throws mid-cancel and breaks
 * cancel entirely. Expanded paste blocks, knowledge blocks, and session-ref
 * links also stay in the text — their collapsed forms lived in drafts that
 * were cleared on send.
 *
 * The shape rules are only CANDIDATE generators. The final arbiter is a
 * byte-exact round trip: the claim stands only when re-serializing the
 * restored state (`prepareSendPayload(text, files).txt`) reproduces the
 * original content exactly; otherwise everything stays verbatim. That is
 * the literal definition of lossless, and it rejects what shape rules
 * cannot see locally — e.g. an own-line @-mention marker mid-text, which
 * would re-serialize as an appended token and reorder the user's words
 * around the attachment.
 *
 * `files` is the entry's own ORDERED non-image attachment list when the
 * server echoed one (slot-detail `queue[]` item or `queue_push` frame),
 * the same list `[attached_file N]` indexes on a user row: marker N names
 * `files[N-1]`. With it the own-line claim needs no shape rule — the marker
 * line is matched by EXACT text, so a spaced bare-upload path
 * (`/tmp/My Report.pdf`) is claimed whole, the shape the wire text alone
 * could never prove. Inline (@-mention) markers and `[attached_dir N]`
 * markers stay verbatim either way: their composer spelling is the `@rel`
 * the user typed, which neither the wire text nor the list records. An
 * entry without a list (a legacy entry, an older gateway) takes the shape
 * rules above unchanged. The round-trip arbiter gates both paths.
