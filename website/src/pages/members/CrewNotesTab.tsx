/**
 * Notes tab — the crewmate's own standing notes ("what it learned").
 *
 * The body is the crewmate's self-maintained briefing markdown
 * (`members/<slug>/briefing.md`), read through
 * `GET /api/members/{slug}/briefing` and rendered by the real
 * `MarkdownRenderer`. A line above the body says whose notes these are and that
 * the tab does not change them — the text is the agent's own working memory,
 * addressed to itself, and a person who reads it as a page written for them
 * looks for an edit control that is deliberately absent.
 * Read-only by design, with no editor: the crewmate
 * writes this file as it works, and the dashboard's file viewer reads through
 * a redacting path whose Save writes the buffer back — an in-dashboard edit of
 * an agent-written file could replace a secret the crewmate wrote in the
 * meantime with its placeholder. The notes are changed where the crewmate
 * keeps them, outside the dashboard. The states, never conflated: loading, a
 * refused read because two crewmates share the slug (the file would belong to
 * neither), failed first read, unsupported platform (the backend fails closed
 * rather than reading the file racily), no notes yet (the normal state of a
 * fresh crewmate — an empty state, not an error), and content — which, when a
 * later refetch fails, stays on screen under a notice saying it may be stale,
 * and which says so above the text when part of it is hidden (a secret
 * replaced by its placeholder, a tail past the cap).
