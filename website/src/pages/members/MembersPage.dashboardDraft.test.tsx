/* The side panel is kept mounted while the Dashboard body holds an UNSENT
 * ANSWER, and released as soon as it does not.
 *
 * Why the page needs telling: a pending question's answer lives only in
 * `QuestionCard`'s own state and `CommandCenterPanel`'s draft bookkeeping. Nothing
 * outside that subtree can see it, so an unmount is the typed text being thrown
 * away and the page would never know. `CommandCenterPanel` therefore reports the
 * state up (`onDraftStateChange`) and the page holds its panel on that alone.
 *
 * Two earlier rules are pinned against here by their consequences, because each
 * looked reasonable and broke something a test had to catch:
 *
 *  - Hold whenever the Dashboard tab has been on screen. Dashboard is the landing
 *    tab, so that held the panel for every crewmate forever; it also kept every
 *    OTHER leading body alive behind the hidden panel, and a Schedules draft the
 *    person had explicitly DISCARDED came back on the next open.
 *  - Hold only while Dashboard is the ACTIVE tab. That fixed the Schedules case
 *    and lost the answer whenever someone typed, left the tab, and then closed
 *    the panel -- two ordinary steps.
 *
 * `CommandCenterPanel` is stubbed here so the report can be driven directly; its
 * own half (deriving the flag from a card's draft) is the command-centre tests'
 * business. The panel's shell is the real one, which is what the hold acts on.
