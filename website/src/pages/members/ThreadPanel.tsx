/**
 * One thread, in the right side panel of whatever chat it hangs off. The main
 * chat stays visible beside it.
 *
 * A thread is an ordinary chat session anchored to one message (NOTES D1), so
 * this panel is a frame around the ORDINARY chat pane rather than a bubble list
 * of its own: header, the anchored message quoted once, then `ChatPane` on the
 * thread's own slot. Everything a chat surface has comes with it — a real
 * composer, many turns, tools, approval cards, steer, queue, stop, model and
 * agent pickers, history. None of it is reimplemented here, and there is no
 * one-reply lock and no client byte cap, because those existed only to keep a
 * throwaway stateless session honest.
 *
 * The same slot is also reachable as an ordinary full page (`/chat/<thread
 * slot>`); the pop-out control in the header goes there. Both are the same
 * session, so leaving one for the other loses nothing.
 *
 * Version 1 threads — written when a thread's replies lived in a sidecar — have
 * no session to render. They arrive with `replies` and no `thread_slot`, and
 * are drawn as a read-only fold under the anchor with one action: start a real
 * thread here (NOTES D3).
 *
 * Escape closes the panel as the close button does, and closing hands focus
 * back to the control that opened it, so a keyboard user lands where they left
 * the chat.
