/**
 * The second line of the crewmate DM header's identity pill: what the crewmate
 * is doing RIGHT NOW, in one short line under its name.
 *
 * The line is always present (the pill never changes height), and it is text
 * only — no dot, no glyph. Presence already has a home (the avatar's own
 * working state), so a second marker here would say the same thing twice.
 *
 * The busy readings come from the ONE seam the dashboard already resolves a
 * slot's live status through: `slotStatusDetail[slot]` (written by the
 * websocket layer on every turn start, reasoning burst, chunk and tool call)
 * rendered by `toolStatusLabel`, exactly as the sessions sidebar and the
 * command palette render theirs. So the pill honours the user's
 * `simplifiedToolNames` preference (purpose in simplified mode, the verbatim
 * command in raw mode, the argument-derived title where the raw one is a
 * stub) and names a moment the same way the sidebar row does. This module
 * adds only what is pill-specific:
 *
 *   reading                   | what the line says
 *   --------------------------|-----------------------------------------------
 *   `tool` status, still open | the shared label (purpose / derived / raw)
 *   `tool` status, returned   | the shared "thinking" copy — the model is
 *                             | reading the result, so the old purpose is stale
 *   `thinking` / `streaming`  | the shared copy for that phase (or a server-
 *                             | supplied status label, verbatim)
 *   run state `compacting`    | "Compacting…"
 *   run state `stopping`      | "Stopping…"
 *   busy, no status yet       | "Working" (the slots frame says busy before the
 *                             | first status frame), or the delegated variant
 *                             | when only sub-agents are running
 *   not busy                  | "Idle · <time ago>", or just "Idle"
 *
 * Every shared label is clamped to `PILL_ACTIVITY_MAX_CHARS` code points with
 * an ellipsis: the pill sits centred over the transcript and a long purpose
 * sentence would push it to the header's full width. The fixed labels never
 * reach the cap.
