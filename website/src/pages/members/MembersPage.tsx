/**
 * Crew Members — one durable, pinned DM thread per crew member.
 *
 * CAPTURED: Settings > Developer > Feature Previews shows a screenshot of this
 * page in its "See what it looks like" dialog. A visible change here makes that
 * picture stale — re-shoot with `scripts/capture-feature-previews.mjs`.
 *
 * The page realizes the B+C merged design: a member list on the left, the
 * selected member's pinned DM thread in the center (the real chat stack,
 * hosted the way split-view panes host it), and on the right the SAME tabbed
 * side panel the chat page docks — shown by default, hidden and shown again by
 * the header opener, the panel's own close control or the dashboard's
 * side-panel chord, with the choice remembered — whose first
 * three tabs are the crewmate's own: Notes (what it learned — its standing
 * notes, read-only here), Work log (what it did) and Dashboard (how things
 * stand — the page it publishes itself), and whose + menu offers the chat
 * panel's own views (Files, Artifacts, Terminal, Browser…) against the member's
 * DM slot, because a member thread IS a chat slot. Settings — the template it
 * is built from, wake sources, memory, cloud — live on the crewmate's detail
 * page (the crew editor), never in the panel.
 * Configuration WRITES are deliberately absent — the header pencil
 * navigates to the existing crew manager (/capabilities?tab=crews), so this
 * page never becomes a second editor.
 *
 * Identity is the exact CREW NAME, never the slug: slugification is lossy
 * (`Oncall` and `oncall` share a slug and therefore one thread directory),
 * so rows are keyed and selected by name, and a thread-open response whose
 * `member` is a DIFFERENT name is surfaced as a collision instead of being
 * silently mounted (first-bound-wins is the backend contract).
 *
 * The pin is a server-side property of member slots (born only through
 * POST /api/members/{slug}/thread). It is an invariant of every member
 * thread, so the UI does not announce it — there is no unpinned state to
 * contrast against.
 *
 * Which crewmate is open rides the URL (`?member=<name>`), and the last one
 * opened is remembered per browser: a visit that names no one lands on the
 * remembered crewmate if it is still on the roster, else on the most recently
 * USED chat (greatest `last_active_ts`). That is the conversation the user
 * most plausibly came back for, and it is a property of the user's own
 * history, not of the list order: #11763 rejected priming the user on
 * whichever row the SORT floated to the top, and that still holds — the
 * default follows use, never the sort. Only an EMPTY roster opens nothing;
 * it shows the New crewmate hero instead. Below md nothing auto-opens (the
 * phone's two-level list rule).

                  The pill IS the member's edit entry: the whole chip is one
                  button (the pane's host, `as="button"`, so the material and
                  the control are the same element) that opens the member's

                  crewmate". It navigates rather than editing here: this page
                  never becomes a second writer (issue #9103). There is no
                  separate pencil: the maintainer dropped the hover-revealed
                  pencil that used to sit right of the name (#9425) once the
                  identity became one clickable pill — a chip that already reads
                  as a control does not need a second control inside it. The
                  face is still not an edit control of its own (#9116): it is a
                  plain face inside the pill, and the pill's label names the
                  editor, not the avatar. No hover step: the pane is the same
                  glass at rest and under the pointer (maintainer decision --
                  the Glass material carries no hover state of its own), so the
                  pointer cursor and the tooltip are the affordance; focus is
                  the app's own ring. The button's accessible NAME is its content — the
                  crewmate's name — so a screen reader still hears who the
                  thread is with and voice control can say the name; what the
                  click does ("Edit crewmate") rides along as the tooltip,
                  which doubles as the accessible description. An aria-label
                  would replace the identity with the verb. */}
