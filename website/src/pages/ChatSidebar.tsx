/**
 * Session-row type scale, quantized to a 4px baseline grid.
 *
 * Every line box is a multiple of 4 and the inter-line gaps are zero — the
 * leading carries the breathing room — so a row is a whole number of grid
 * units (12px padding + 12 + 20 + 16 = 60) and consecutive rows stack on the
 * grid instead of drifting. The previous scale mixed three RATIOS
 * (`leading-tight` / `leading-snug`) over 11/13/12px text, which produced
 * 13.75 / 17.875 / 16.5px boxes: no line landed on the grid and the row height
 * was an arbitrary 62.125px.
 *
 * The three sizes are also spread far enough apart to READ as a hierarchy.
 * 11/13/12 sat within 2px of each other, and CJK glyphs fill their em box, so
 * the secondary line competed with the headline instead of yielding to it.
 *
 * The three boxes need NOT be equal to each other. Row-centring the status
 * marker did require the first and last to match — it is the only way
 * headline-centre can coincide with row-centre — and that constraint is gone
 * because the marker now leads the secondary line and centres on IT.
 * Which is what buys the meta line its 12px box: the tightest of the three,
 * spent on the least important line.

/** Rows at or past this paint ordinal share ONE `orderStamp`, so an insertion

 *  (see SessionRowProps). Stamped as a plain ordinal, a New Chat landing at the
 *  top of a 160-session sidebar shifts every ordinal by one and voids all 160
 *  memo boundaries in one commit — 160 row bodies, 160 layout measurements and

 *  sliding down by one slot. The rows below the fold are displaced too, but
 *  nobody sees them move, so their spring buys nothing.
 *
 *  48 rows is roughly two sidebar viewports of 56px rows: the visible
 *  displacement stays continuous (the persistent-element rule in
 *  website/AGENTS.md is about what the user can see move), while the per-insert
 *  cost is bounded by this constant instead of growing with the session count.
 *  The deliberate casualty: a user scrolled deep into the list sees rows beyond
 *  the window snap rather than slide when something above them moves. The
 *  ordinal-bump above the window still has its usual cost, so this is a bound,
 *  not a fix for rows inside it. Pinned by ChatSidebar.rowMemo.test.tsx. */

   *      the gateway down the provider's own page is the only thing that can
   *      answer at all.
   *    - `onOpenSource` returning false — the panel could not resolve this url,

 * (the pattern every non-thunk call site uses) reads `undefined`. `apiFailure`
 * journals the status and the code keyed by the message that DOES survive, which
 * is what `findReport` looks back up. See `utils/thunkError`'s module doc.
 *
 * `adopt_target_unknown` gets copy that names the crew, because its backend
 * sentence does not; anything else shows the backend's own sentence (`apiFailure`
 * already unwrapped it out of the `{error, code}` envelope), and a fixed sentence
 * is the floor — a failed click must never render nothing, which is the defect
 * this exists to fix.
 *
 * `remote_bind_failed` deliberately has NO case of its own. The backend collapses
 * every refusal on the bind leg to that one code — a dead tunnel, but also a
 * version-parity refusal ("This crew runs Kiro Crew 0.6.0 but this machine runs
 * 0.7.0 …") — and only its sentence tells them apart. A fixed "could not reach"
 * string here would render a healthy, reachable crew as unreachable and hide the
 * one line that tells the user which end to update. The sentence is always present
 * for a journaled code: `findReport` matches on a non-empty message, so a code
 * with no message is unreachable and a fallback for it would be dead code. */

  /**
   * THE single declaration of every filter dimension. `filteredSlots`,

   * adding a dimension is one entry here — the required fields force a
   * decision per consumer, and THOSE THREE consumers cannot drift because
   * none of them enumerates dimensions itself any more. The guard's limit:
   * this declaration cannot see filtering done at the render sites (the
   * folder dimension works that way), so a dimension that acts there must
   * still answer `narrows` for real — writing `null` while narrowing the
   * visible list at a render site re-creates the under-count this exists to
   * prevent.
   *
   * The consumers legitimately answer different questions, and the per-field
   * differences below are deliberate, not drift:
   * - the folder dimension filters no rows (`filtersRow: null` — it drops
   *   whole folder blocks/lanes at the render sites) and never narrows
   *   (`narrows: null` — see the field docs on `FilterDimension`);
   * - tags narrow by the RESOLVED `activeTagIds` but hide by the raw
   *   `filterTagIds`, so a reveal arriving while the tag vocabulary is still
   *   loading (when nothing is filtered yet) still clears the tag filter
   *   instead of leaving the row to be re-hidden mid-flight.
   *
   * Bundling every consumer's state into one memo couples them: a change to
   * reveal-only state (`filterTagIds`, `filterHiddenSubtree`, `folders`)
   * re-derives `filteredSlots` — one extra filter+sort with content-identical
   * rows. Accepted: no effect keys on `filteredSlots`, and its downstream
   * memos already depend on that state themselves.

                    Warn, not accent: the view toggle immediately beside it tints accent
                    to mean "this lane is active", so one accent doing both jobs reads as
                    the toggle's own state rather than as a population kept off screen.

                    The count does NOT go in the accessible name. A button's name names
                    the button; a count that changes under the reader belongs in content,
                    and every lane draws it as content — a reveal row where there are
                    folder headers to hang one from, the lane notice in a board. That also
                    keeps the name stable for a reader navigating by control name. Both

                        subfolder, so a row that matched nothing can sit in that
                        list, and a sentence claiming it matched is the same
                        contradiction with the roles reversed. It claims only that
