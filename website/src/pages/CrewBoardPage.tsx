/**
 * CrewBoardPage — the conductor's work items, as a board a human can scan.
 *
 * Implements Phase 4 ("the surfaces", Crew page half) of
 * `docs/request-for-change/rfc-conductor-work-ledger.md`. It reads the masked
 * projection at `GET /api/crew-board`, never the conductor's own MCP route: no
 * row here carries `worker_session_key`, and the text of a `bind` event arrives
 * blanked, so there is nothing on this page that could address a worker session.
 *
 * ## Why the bands, and why this order
 *
 * A conductor's board is read for ONE reason: to find the item that cannot move
 * without a human. So items waiting on a decision are lifted out of document order
 * into a band at the top — if finding a blocked worker needs a scroll, the board
 * has failed at the only job it has. Everything still open follows. Terminal items
 * collapse behind an expander, because a finished item is evidence rather than
 * work and a board that grows forever stops being scannable.
 *
 * ## Zero model turns
 *
 * The browser polls every 10 s. No agent wakes to render this, no turn is spent,
 * and nothing is pushed: the RFC's push half is PR A (the wake hook), which lands
 * separately. `channels_available` arrives `false` until the RFC's Phase 5 ships
 * the channel records, so that band turns on server-side with no edit here.
 *
 * ## Status badges render the store's own tokens
 *
 * `status`, `state`, `verdict` and `alive` are shown verbatim as the store spells
 * them. They are a technical vocabulary shared by the MCP tools, the event log and
 * this page, and a translated synonym would mean the page and the tool a conductor
 * just ran disagree about what an item is. Only prose is localized.
