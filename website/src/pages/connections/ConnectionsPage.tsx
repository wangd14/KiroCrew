 *  |------------|-----------------|-------|-------|-------|-----------|
 *  | absent     | either          | keep  |  no   |  no   |    no     |
 *  | minting    | either          | keep  |  no   |  no   |    no     |
 *  | waiting    | either          | keep  |  no   |  no   |    no     |
 *  | granted    | either          | clear | YES   |  no   |    no     |
 *  | failed     | new-this-flow   | clear |  no   | YES   |    no     |
 *  | failed     | pre-existing    | clear |  no   | YES   |    no     |
 *  | expired    | any             | clear |  no   |  no   |
 *
 *  No terminal state deletes configuration. An expired mint clears this tab's
 *  wait and leaves the entry in place, so the card shows needs-attention and the
 *  user retries with Connect or removes it with Disconnect. Deleting an entry on
 *  a timeout meant racing a sibling tab for the same slug-keyed row, and no
 *  amount of token fencing makes an automatic delete worth that: config removal
 *  is a decision the user makes explicitly.
 *
 *  Two rows carry the reasoning:
 *  - `granted` must PROBE. The card's cached status predates consent, so without
 *    a fresh read it keeps showing the pre-consent error after authorization
 *    succeeded.
 *  - `failed` keeps the entry on purpose. Something went wrong rather than timed
 *    out, so the error surface plus a retryable entry beats silently undoing the
 *    install.

          are made: a newly enabled server reaches a chat that is already
          running only after its session is relaunched. Outside the tablist so

          restarts and what is kept BEFORE the click — "Restart" alone reads as
          "interrupts whatever is running", and the confirm is too late for the
