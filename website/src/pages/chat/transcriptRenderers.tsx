/**
 * transcriptRenderers — the dashboard's row set for the shared chat transcript.
 *
 * This is the ONE dashboard row set (chat-core P5-b): the single-chat surface
 * (ChatPage) spreads this factory into its host list and adds only its
 * page-only entries (the conversational bubble with fork/pin/footer chrome,
 * the undrawn/permission rows); ChatPane calls it with fewer options. Rows the
 * SDK default registry already draws from the same component and the same
 * inputs -- the stop-event card, the notice card, the MCP OAuth banner -- are
 * registered NOWHERE else: not here (a second copy is what the "leaves the
 * stop row to the SDK default" test pins shut) and, since P5-c, not on the
 * page either. Behaviour a surface cannot supply is an
 * OPTION with the pane's default -- the tool row's disclosure key, its
 * "animating" rule, the hot-transcript hint, the completion cards' session
 * hand-offs -- so the two surfaces differ only in what they wire, never in
 * how a row is drawn.
 * Every OTHER dashboard surface draws through app-sdk/ChatMessageList, whose
 * default registry is deliberately store-free and therefore renders a WEAKER
 * transcript: a static pill instead of the live tool line, and nothing at all
 * for a thinking trace, a sent file, an auto-nudge turn, a workflow launch, a
 * sub-agent launch, a recovery inject or a workflow completion. This module
 * carries ChatPage's row set as registry entries so a second surface reads the
 * SAME transcript rather than a reduced one.
 *
 * It lives under pages/chat rather than in app-sdk on purpose: the registry's
 * own module must stay importable by consumers that have no Redux store at all,
 * so anything store-connected is supplied BY the host as an entry — which is
 * exactly what this is.
 *
 * The returned array is merged AHEAD of the SDK defaults (see mergeRenderers),
 * so an entry reusing a default's `id` REPLACES it, a new `id` ADDS a row type,
 * and a narrow entry must precede the broader one it refines.
