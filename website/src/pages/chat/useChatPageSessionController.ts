   *  `ownsSessionTabs` is the ONE predicate deciding both who draws the strip

   *  also mounted by embedded hosts — a popped-out window, the artifact

   *  reconcile the key, overwriting the dashboard's working set with a session
   *  it never opened. `embedded` is exactly that line: every one of those hosts
   *  passes it, and the routed /chat surface passes none of these flags.
   *
   *  Switching is dispatched HERE rather than inside the hook: `switchSlot` is
   *  the surface's one session-entry path (URL sync, transcript hydration and
   *  the composer all hang off it), and a second caller inside a layout hook
