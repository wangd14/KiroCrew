  // POSIX, `\` is a legal filename character: a nested file `src/main.ts`
  // and a literal filename `src\main.ts` in the project root are distinct.
  // The current-project check uses `isWindowsShapedPath` directly against the
  // drive-letter/UNC prefix, including Windows paths already written with `/`.
  // The shared `tokenRegex`'s trailing boundary requires whitespace or
  // end-of-string, so an entirely ordinary sentence -- "check @file.ts,
  // please" -- reads as "mention gone" the instant the comma is typed,
  // and the reconciliation effect below silently unstages a still-
  // intended attachment before the user finishes the sentence (fork GPT
  // review). Before this PR nothing acted on that gap: a file chip was
  // pure list state with no text-driven staleness check at all, so
  // `tokenRegex`'s pre-existing punctuation blind spot never had a
  // user-visible consequence. This reconciliation-only boundary also
  // accepts common trailing punctuation, scoped here rather than
  // widening the shared `tokenRegex` (used for insertion/splicing
  // elsewhere, where an inserted token is always followed by a real
  // space per the caret-insertion logic above). A bare punctuation
  // character is NOT enough on its own, though (fork GPT review): `.` is
  // a legal, common mid-filename character (`README.md`), so treating it
  // as a sufficient boundary by itself would match `@README` as a
  // PREFIX of the unrelated, longer `@README.md` mention. Each
  // punctuation option is therefore itself required to be followed by
  // whitespace or end-of-string. Shared with the remove-chip strip below
  // (round 16) so the two can never disagree about what counts as a
  // boundary.
  // A punctuation boundary can itself be the START of a DIFFERENT staged
  // file's own longer alias (fork GPT review, round 18): `report` and
  // `report,` can both be genuine, distinct filenames, so accepting a
  // bare trailing comma as `report`'s boundary matches it as a PREFIX of
  // `report,`'s own mention -- silently mis-attributing the LONGER file's
  // text to the shorter one on both sides of the reconciliation contract
  // (staleness AND remove-chip strip). Falls back to the strict
  // whitespace/end-only boundary whenever another currently-relevant
  // alias literally begins with this one, so a trailing punctuation
  // character that could belong to a real sibling file's name is never
  // treated as "just punctuation." `otherAliases` is optional: callers
  // with no cross-file context to check against (none currently) get the

   *    Splitting it breaks the reference, so a file chip unstages or a
   *    folder silently drops out of the send (fork Opus review);
   *  - a recorded file alias, checked FIRST because it can contain spaces
   *    (`@My Report.pdf`, written unquoted by the picker): the run around a

  // Each path can carry MULTIPLE recorded aliases (fork GPT review): a later

  // re-deriving against the NEW project would falsely call it stale and drop
  // a still-referenced attachment).
  //
  // Entries are NOT deleted on unstage, nor on the chip's own ✕ -- keeping
  // the mapping alive is what makes revival possible, and it is how an undo
  // after ✕ brings the attachment back with its mention. The ✕ drops them
  // only when a mention it could not strip is left in the text.
  // Uploaded/dropped files carry no recorded aliases and are never touched by
  // either direction -- there is no text mention to lose or regain.
  //
  // Revival, unlike the stale check above, DOES cross-check each candidate
  // alias's rel against a fresh re-derivation under the CURRENT project (fork
  // GPT review): an entry that survived an earlier unstage can be for a path
  // whose alias no longer matches what that same rel would mean under the
  // project the slot has SINCE moved to. Reviving it purely because the text
  // happens to contain that rel again -- typed with the NEW project's own
  // file in mind -- would silently attach the OLD, unrelated absolute path
  // instead. An alias is skipped (not merely blocked) when the two ever
  // disagree, so a stale cross-project alias can never revive on a
  // coincidental rel match.
