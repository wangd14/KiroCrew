          are about, rather than on the chat. Both hooks fail closed —
          a failed `/api/apps` renders no chips, a failed status probe
          renders a stateless one — and either is indistinguishable
          from "no app declares a control", so without this the user
          sees a feature silently missing and has nothing to act on.
          One notice covers both: they are the same feature to the
          user, and the composer shares a row with the message input.
          `askAgent` is on because nothing here holds an unsaved
          draft, and a failed app-list or status route is squarely
          something the agent can investigate.

          The folder query rides along rather than getting its own
          banner: it feeds the folder NAME handed to each control, and
          on `/embed/chat` no sidebar is mounted to consume the shared
          ['chat-folders'] cache — so this is the only place its
          failure can be seen at all. It is gated on a control
          actually existing, though: with no chips on screen a folder
          failure is not a session-control problem, and calling it one
          would put an unexplained notice on every composer. */}
