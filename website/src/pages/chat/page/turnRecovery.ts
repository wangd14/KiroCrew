  // A turn can end without the assistant handing the floor back: the connection
  // dropped, the gateway restarted during an app update, the app was force-quit,
  // or the runner's own recovery ladder gave up. Some of those leave evidence (an
  // unanswered user row, a trailing error card) and some leave none at all — a
  // force-quit runs no cleanup, so its transcript is indistinguishable from a
  // clean finish. Continue is therefore offered on any idle slot with a
  // conversation, and `interrupted` only decides how the button describes itself.
  //
  // The two COMPOSE at the ErrorCard; neither alone is right. `continuable` is the
  // availability half (running, stopping, pending turn, autopilot, subagents,
  // queue) and `interrupted` is the placement half — `i === lastErrorIdx` means
  // "newest error row", never "the transcript ends badly", so on
  // `[user, error, user, assistant]` availability alone would put a Continue
  // button on a superseded failure card that acts on a LATER request. Dropping
  // `continuable` instead is the mirror-image bug: `selectTurnInterrupted` carries
  // none of the busy checks, so a card would offer a Continue that `handleContinue`
  // early-returns on — a dead control in the one place recovery is promised.
