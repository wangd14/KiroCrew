 * into a tone here and stripped — the icon renders as a proper lucide glyph in
 * the leading slot instead — which also cleans up history rows written by
 * older gateways without needing a migration. Only these three glyphs are

/**
 * Soft notice row ("the gateway did something routine on your behalf" — an

 *
 * Shares RecoveryCard's visual grammar — the same ring, background, radius,
 * padding step, 13px/leading-5 type and 13px lucide icon in a gap-2 leading
 * slot — because on the main chat transcript the two rows land stacked in the
 * same episode (an empty-response episode emits both) and must read as one
 * family, not two unrelated boxes. The severity split extends RecoveryCard's:
 * info keeps the muted glyph, warn gets the warning triangle, and blocked (a
 * policy denial) gets its own Ban glyph in the danger color, so a security
 * block is never dressed as a routine warning. Distinct glyph shapes also
 * carry the severity under forced-colors, where the tint does not survive.
 *
 * Unlike RecoveryCard's single-line truncated header, notice copy wraps, so
 * the row top-aligns and the icon is nudged onto the first line's vertical
 * center. The nudge is calc((1.25rem − 1em) / 2): leading-5 is a rem line box
 * while the glyph is 1em of the fixed 13px type, so a px constant would drift
 * under a non-16px root font-size.
