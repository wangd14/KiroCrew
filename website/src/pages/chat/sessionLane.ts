/** Derived board lanes: which live runtime state a session is in.
 *
 *  A tag column answers "what did someone file this session under". A lane
 *  answers "what is this session doing right now", which is the question a
 *  board of agent sessions actually has — and nothing writes a tag when an
 *  agent starts working or stops for an approval, so a tag board of workflow
 *  states never moves on its own.
 *
 *  Two properties make lanes safe to render a whole board from, and both are
 *  load-bearing rather than incidental:
 *
 *  - **Exhaustive.** `idle` is the fallback, so every session lands somewhere.
 *    A card that matched no lane would simply disappear from the board.
 *  - **Mutually exclusive.** The first matching rule wins, so a session appears
 *    in exactly one lane. A multi-tag session renders once per matching tag
 *    column; a lane card has one home, which is what makes the column counts
 *    add up to the session total.
