 * since every control in it takes its label from a map keyed by the SERVER's id.
 *

/**
 * Decisions (Jev) — Settings › Developer › Feature Previews.
 *
 * ## Why it is a list and a detail
 *
 * This card used to be one column of prose: a switch, four paragraphs about what
 * leaves the machine, a second switch, an address, and one read-only row naming the
 * single thing Jev decided. Every point that shipped afterwards had to land in the
 * same column, so the card grew into a wall in which the reader's actual question —
 * "what does Jev decide for me, and is that one on" — was the hardest thing to find.
 *
 * So it takes the shape `AgentBackendTab` already uses for the same problem: the
 * POINTS are a list, one row each, and the panel beside it belongs to whichever row
 * is highlighted. Exactly one panel is ever rendered. A row carries the plain-words
 * name, one line of what it decides, and a status chip; everything a reader might
 * change about that point lives in its own panel, so the card is scannable at the
 * top level and complete one level down.
 *
 * Highlighting a row changes the panel and nothing else — no row is a switch. That
 * separation is what lets a point that is NOT running still get a row, which is the
 * state a reader most needs to be able to read about.
 *
 * ## Where the list comes from, and why not from here
 *
 * `GET /api/decisions/consent` projects one row per point the GATEWAY ships, from
 * the seam's own registry (`decisions/gate.py`). This file holds a LABEL per id and
 * no array of ids, exactly as `AgentBackendTab` holds a label per capability: a
 * build that ships another point lights up a row with no edit here, and a point this
 * build has no label for renders under its own identifier rather than vanishing. An
 * array written here would be a second registry, and the two would diverge silently
 * — the failure that makes a card claim a decision the gate will never make.
 *
 * `status` is the SERVER's verdict for the same reason `permits` is. It is the
 * EFFECTIVE answer, never a switch position: `off` covers every reason nothing is
 * sent, and `needs_scope` is its own value because the fix for it is a switch on the
 * point's own panel, not the main switch the reader already turned on.
 *
 * NO NUMBER rides a row, and that is a gap rather than a decision about layout: this
 * gateway keeps a decision LOG (`decisions/log.py`) but ships no reader for it, so
 * there is no agree rate and no turn count to print. Counting rows here would mean
 * adding a log aggregator, which is a mechanism this card does not get to invent.
 * The row is designed with the space for it.
 *
 * ## The global block, and why its switch is not inside the disclosure
 *
 * Above the list sits what the whole seam shares: the main consent switch, where
 * decisions are sent, the credential, the sampling share and the prior-conversation
 * budget. The last four are behind a disclosure that is CLOSED by default, because a
 * reader opening this card is asking about points and not about a char budget.
 *
 * The SWITCH is not, and neither is the sentence saying what leaves the machine.
 * Consent to send conversation text off the machine is the one fact on this card a
 * reader must meet without looking for it, and `AgentBackendTab` states the rule this
 * follows: a fact behind a closed disclosure is a fact they do not see. So the
 * disclosure holds the settings and never the consent.
 *
 * ## What each value is written to, which is three different places
 *
 * - **Consent and its scopes** — the keystone `decisions_consent.json`, through
 *   `/api/decisions/consent`. Not a config path: `config.json` is writable by an
 *   auto-approved agent shell, so a switch there could be flipped by a
 *   prompt-injected agent (see `decisionsPreview.ts`).
 * - **The credential** — the dashboard SECRETS VAULT, as the one entry
 *   `TYPESAFE_API_KEY`. `provider.api_key` honours `secret://TYPESAFE_API_KEY` and
 *   nothing else, so no key is ever written to `config.json` and none is ever read
 *   back: the field shows set or unset, never a value.
 * - **Everything else** — `config.json`, through the config PATCH the settings page
 *   already uses. Those values grant nothing on their own: they can only narrow what
 *   consent allows, or name a model the provider must already advertise.
 *
 * A per-point SCOPE switch omits `enabled` deliberately (`api.saveDecisionsScope`).
 * A scope is not a review of an address, so it must not restate consent to one; the
 * gateway preserves the recorded switch for an absent field and refuses the write
 * unless consent is already in force for the address config names.
 *
 * ## Governance, and the one state that hides rather than explains
 *
 * `capabilities.decisions` is a fleet ceiling resolved server-side and reported as
 * `decisions_enabled` on `GET /api/dashboard/config`. A fleet that pinned the seam
 * off gets NO CARD — not a disabled one — because a ceiling is not a state the user
 * can act on. A FAILED read is not a withdrawal and must not be silent: the card
 * fades and says the read failed, because nothing has been denied and the reader can
 * retry.
