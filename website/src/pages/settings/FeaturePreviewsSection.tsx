/**
 * Settings > Developer > Feature Previews — opt in to surfaces that ship in the
 * bundle but are not released yet (see `utils/previewFlags.ts`).
 *
 * Formerly its own tab on the standalone Developer page (`/developer`). It moved
 * here because the switch that HOLDS an unreleased feature belongs next to the
 * switch that REVEALS the developer tooling (Developer Mode, one section up):
 * both are consent gates, and a reader looking for "how do I turn the unfinished
 * thing on" looks in Settings, not on an internals page they first have to
 * unlock. `DeveloperPage.tsx` redirects the old
 * `/developer?tab=feature-previews` link here.
 *
 * The USER-FACING copy says "features" and "pages", never "surfaces": `Surface`
 * is the registry's internal term and means nothing to the operator reading the
 * toggle. The component and catalog keys keep the code vocabulary on purpose —
 * they name the mechanism, not the copy. The catalog keys also keep their
 * historical `pages.developer.featurePreviewsTab.*` namespace: renaming seven
 * keys across fourteen catalogs buys no user-visible change, and the section
 * itself still describes the developer-tooling gate it started as.
 *
 * ONE CARD PER FEATURE, and everything that belongs to a feature lives inside
 * its card: the headline, the sentence explaining what state it is in, its
 * toggle, and any ingress that only appears once it is on. A reader scanning the
 * section can then take a card as the whole story of one preview, rather than
 * pairing a row against an ingress rendered somewhere below it.
 *
 * One explicit card per preview flag rather than a loop over a table: the copy
 * has to be a static `i18nT('literal')` call for `check-i18n-keys.mjs` to
 * resolve it, and a table of key strings indexed per card is exactly the dynamic
 * pattern that gate cannot follow. A preview flag is also meant to be
 * short-lived, so the cost of a card is paid once and then deleted with it.
 *
 * Under `pages/settings/` ON PURPOSE, reversing the old tab's stance:
 * `gen-settings-registry.mjs` scans this directory, so these toggles ARE
 * indexed into Settings search (`PANEL_TAB_MAP` maps this file to `developer`).
 * The old tab kept itself out of the index so that searching "webhooks" would
 * not advertise a hidden page. In Settings the calculus flips: a control the
 * user can see on a Settings pane but cannot find through Settings search is
 * the exact coverage gap the settings-coverage gate exists to close, and what
 * the search hit reaches is the opt-in switch — labelled as a preview — not the
 * page it holds. The PAGE stays un-advertised: `getAdvertisedSurfaces()` and
 * the Search Everywhere Pages provider still filter it until the flag is on.
 *
 * No `configKey` on the four `previewFlags.ts` toggles, deliberately: that prop
 * is what makes a `<SettingRef>` chip deep-link here and what feeds
 * `settingsRegistry.gen.ts`, and a per-device localStorage flag has no config
 * path to name at all. Search deep-links still reach every toggle through its
 * registry id + `data-setting-label`, which need no configKey.
 *
 * The Decisions toggle (now in `DecisionsCard.tsx`) carries no `configKey` either,
 * for a different reason: it writes no config path. Its value is the KEYSTONE
 * `decisions_consent.json`, reached through `/api/decisions/consent`, because
 * `config.json` is writable by an auto-approved agent shell and consent to send
 * message text off the machine must not be (see `decisionsPreview.ts`). A
 * `configKey` naming a config path nothing reads would be the drift the
 * `test_settingref_schema_fixture.py` guard exists to catch, so its absence here
 * is asserted by `decisionsPreview.test.ts`.
 *
 * Each card may also carry a "See what it looks like" button (`FeaturePreviewIntroButton`)
 * opening a dialog with a REAL capture of the surface the flag reveals, a
 * sentence on what it does, where it appears once on, and the same switch again.
 * The intro is defined right here next to its card — the card IS the preview's
 * definition — as a render-time builder rather than a table of catalog keys,
 * for the same `check-i18n-keys.mjs` reason the cards are not a loop: the gate
 * resolves a literal `i18nT('…')`, not a key read out of a nested object. A
 * preview whose surface has not been captured yet (below: "Chat on a crew",
 * whose menu entry only exists with a live tunnel to a second machine, which an
 * isolated capture instance cannot honestly stage) simply has no builder and so
 * no button — never a dialog with an empty frame.
