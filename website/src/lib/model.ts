/** Model-id helpers shared by every surface that displays a slot's model.
 *
 *  The picker's list and the slot's pinned model come from two different places
 *  (`GET /api/models` vs. the slots payload), so they can disagree — most
 *  visibly after a plan downgrade, where the slot stays pinned to a premium
 *  model the account can no longer run. The backend withholds such a model at
 *  spawn and runs the session on its own default, so displaying the pin would
 *  name a model no turn will use. The slots payload carries the backend's own
 *  verdict for that case (`model_withheld`), so the answer is read rather than
 *  cross-referenced out of the two lists; list membership is only the fallback
 *  for a slot that has no verdict yet.

/** Canonical key for comparing model ids across spelling variants.
 *
 *  Mirrors `_normalize_model_key` in `dashboard/handlers/agents.py`: both route
 *  a model id through the shared canonical registry (`model_registry.json`) so
 *  "same model?" has ONE definition across the dashboard (picker, slot display,
 *  and the #5306 subagent downgrade flag).
 *
 *  Resolution order:
 *  1. `auto`/`default`/unset -> the `auto` sentinel (both mean "let the backend
 *     pick"); an empty id stays `''` (no pin, distinct from Auto).
 *  2. Registry canonical key: a canonical key, a registry alias, or a
 *     claude_code provider id — with or without a region/vendor routing prefix
 *     (`us.anthropic.…`, `global.anthropic.…`) — folds to its canonical key.
 *     This is what makes an alias and its provider-prefixed canonical id equal
 *     (`us.anthropic.claude-opus-4-8[1m]` ≡ `claude-opus-4.8` -> `opus-4.8-1m`)
 *     while keeping DISTINCT registry entries distinct — notably the advertised
 *     dashed `claude-opus-4-8` (200K, `opus-4.8`) does NOT fold onto dotted
 *     `claude-opus-4.8` (1M, `opus-4.8-1m`); the old dot->dash fold conflated
 *     those two genuinely different context-window models (#5339).
 *  3. Fallback for an id the registry does not list (GPT/DeepSeek/Qwen, future
 *     models, operator-typed ids): the historical lossless fold — trim,
 *     lowercase, `.`->`-` — so behavior is identity-preserving off the
 *     registered set, matching the backend's pass-through contract.

/** The model id to DISPLAY for a slot pinned to `pinned`.
 *
 *  `withheld` is the backend's OWN verdict for this pin, carried in the slots
 *  payload (`model_withheld`), and it wins whenever it exists: it was computed
 *  at spawn against the live session's advertised list — the same list the
 *  withhold itself is applied from — so it answers "will a turn use this pin?"
 *  directly. `true` -> `auto`, `false` -> the pin. Inferring the answer from
 *  picker-list membership instead made every filter applied to `/api/models` an
 *  entitlement signal: deprecated ids are dropped there BEFORE the entitlement
 *  narrowing, so a deprecated-but-runnable pin had no row to match and read as
 *  `auto` (#1819).
 *
 *  `null`/`undefined` is the third state — no verdict yet (no session has
 *  advertised a comparable list for this pin) — and it must fail open, so it
 *  falls back to the list-membership heuristic below. Unknown is not denied.
 *
 *  Without a verdict: returns `'auto'` when the pin is absent from `models`,
 *  since the picker's list is narrowed to what the live session says the account
 *  can run.
 *
 *  `degraded` is the authority on whether the list can be trusted, and it must
 *  come from `modelsDegraded(providerId)` — NOT from the list's shape. A cached
 *  multi-row list served while `/api/models` is failing looks perfectly healthy
 *  by length while being arbitrarily stale, so length alone would relabel a pin
 *  the account has (re)gained access to. When `degraded` is true the pin is
 *  returned untouched: entitlement unknown is not entitlement denied. It gates
 *  the heuristic only — a verdict does not come from that list, so a stale list
 *  says nothing about it.
 *
 *  `effective` is the id the live session resolved to, and it is consulted ONLY
 *  when everything above lands on `auto`. `auto` is the truthful answer for a
 *  slot that inherits (no pin, or a withheld one) but it names nothing a user
 *  can recognise, while the session is running one specific model. So that one
 *  case is replaced by the model's own picker row — an id the list does not
 *  carry stays `auto`, since a chip matching no row is worse than the honest
 *  sentinel. Every other answer is returned untouched.
 *
 *  This is a DISPLAY decision only. Never feed the result into a write — a
 *  lossy label must not become persisted state (see ChatPage's pin-to-agent
 *  row, which writes the slot's real model).
