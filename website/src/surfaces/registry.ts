/**
 * Surface registry — single source of truth for top-level navigation
 * destinations in the dashboard.
 *
 * The left rail contains a mix of static built-in nav items (Chat,
 * Notifications, Settings, ...) and dynamic app nav items (loaded from
 * installed apps). Both kinds register here through one shape: a `Surface`
 * describes a nav destination plus how its badge count is derived. `App.tsx`
 * iterates the registry exactly once to render nav items and their badges;
 * `ChatPage` resolves the slot filter via `surface.slotMode` instead of a
 * hardcoded comparison; new surfaces (built-in or third-party) register one
 * entry and everything else (route, badge, slot routing) just works.
 *
 * Slot-bearing vs non-slot surfaces:
 * - **Slot-bearing** surfaces (`slotMode` set) — Chat (`''`) and any future
 *   modes — pull their badge count from
 *   `selectUnreadByMode(slotMode)`. These are also the surfaces ChatPage
 *   filters slots into.
 * - **Non-slot** surfaces (no `slotMode`) — Notifications and third-party
 *   apps — supply their own `unreadSelector` that reads from wherever their
 *   truth lives (notifications slice, app's own state, etc.).
 *
 * Adding a new chat-mode surface (e.g. a future "Code Review" mode):
 *   registerBuiltinSurface({
 *     navId: 'reviews',
 *     route: '/reviews',
 *     label: 'Reviews',
 *     icon: <GitPullRequest size={16} />,
 *     group: 'Apps',
 *     slotMode: 'reviews',
 *     badgeLabel: 'unread reviews',
 *   })
 * — the badge, the route filter, and the unread routing fall out for free.
