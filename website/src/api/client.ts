/**
 * The dashboard's API client: the `api` singleton and the transport under it.
 *
 * This module owns the transport and its auth recovery: the `X-Session-Key`
 * default, the request helpers, the `j`/`jNullable` parsers that journal every
 * failure as an `ApiError`, the 403 `X-Auth-Required` silent refresh, the
 * embedded-pane hand-off, the re-auth banner and the stale-owner prompt. It
 * installs those helpers as the blessed `apiTransport` at load.
 *
 * The endpoints themselves live by domain under `./client/`, one module per
 * product area, each a `create*Endpoints` factory handed that transport. `api`
 * is assembled here from their segments, spread in the order the methods have
 * always had, so it stays one plain object: `vi.spyOn(api, name)` and the
 * `{ ...mod.api, name: vi.fn() }` mock factories keep working. The wire types
 * those modules own are re-exported below, so every import path is unchanged.

  // `selectors` are the row's own from the list: `scope` / `workspace` pick the
  // JSONL file (the route defaults to the global one, so a workspace row's delete
  // has to carry them back), and `exact` narrows the rule match to the whole
  // rule -- the route matches by SUBSTRING by default, which is right for a CLI
  // fragment and wrong for a table row that holds the full text ("use tabs"
  // would also take "always use tabs").

  // absent field, so an ordinary switch flip can neither grant nor erase it. Pass a
  // boolean only for the switch the owner actually acted on — including `false`,
  // because on this route a revoke has to be written and cannot be left out.
  // `enabled` is OPTIONAL, and leaving it out is what makes a scope write safe rather
  // than careful: a body that carries the switch can only carry what this client last
  // read, so a view read before a revoke turns egress back on. Omitted, the route reads
  // the switch and the endpoint off the keystone under its own lock, and the write moves
  // only the scopes named. A body with neither the switch nor a scope is a 400.
