/**
 * Types for the Crew page's work-item board (`GET /api/crew-board`).
 *
 * These mirror the server's MASKED projection in
 * `kiro_crew/dashboard/handlers/work_ledger_board.py`, not the conductor's own
 * `work_ledger_read` shape. The difference is deliberate and is the point of the
 * endpoint: `worker_session_key` is absent from every row, and the text of a
 * `bind` event — which IS a session key — arrives blanked. So there is no field
 * here the page could use to address a worker session, which is why a row's
 * actions are keyed by `item_id` and resolved server-side.
 *
 * `alive`, `orphaned`, `stale`, `outstanding`, `terminal` and `acceptance_concrete`
 * are all DERIVED server-side rather than stored, so the page never recomputes
 * them: a second implementation of "is this stale" would drift from the store's.
