  // surface is three methods (resolved height vs measurement-or-undefined, and
  // promoting vs not) rather than one.
  //
  // The hot paths (per-rAF scroll window recompute, offset/total spacers, the
  // 120ms streaming tick) would otherwise walk all N rows via the O(N) free
  // functions (getOffset / getTotalHeight / computeWindow), which dominates
  // scroll frames on 5000+ row transcripts. The tree is synced HERE on an
  // itemCount / estimate change so the offset memos have fresh data on the same
  // render, and additionally on height changes by `scheduleHeightSync` (the
  // 120ms tick). It is NOT synced on the per-rAF scroll path (a same-count sync
  // still O(N)-scans the prefix).
  //
  // ONE session guard, and ONE record of session identity. Previously the cache
  // and the tree each carried their own guard and both had to agree: switching to
  // a different session with the SAME item count changes neither itemCount nor
  // the getter's identity, so a guard on only one of them left the tree serving
  // the previous transcript's heights -- a transcript opening at the wrong scroll
  // position. Because the owner holds both, the tree cannot outlive its cache.

  // The guard reads the session off the OWNER rather than a parallel ref beside
  // it. A second spelling of the same identity is the very pattern this change
  // exists to remove, and it could drift from the owner it describes; asking the
  // owner what session it holds cannot. `?.` covers the first render, where the
  // absent owner reads as "not this session" and constructs.
  // Height identity = session PLUS the caller's height scope (width bucket).
  // Measured heights are only valid for the width they were measured at: a
  // phone loading a desktop-measured cache treats every wrong height as a
  // "measurement", and the per-row corrections on mount read as continuous

  // own write, and at every scroll event. Paired with the live height above,
  // it is what lets a fire measure how far the reader's row ACTUALLY moved
  // rather than summing how far the batch's heights say it should have.
  //
  // The distinction is the engine's native scroll anchoring. Chromium adjusts
  // scrollTop for a reprice above the viewport DURING the layout that
  // reprices it -- before any ResizeObserver callback, before its own scroll
  // event -- so by the time the fire arrives the reader's row may already be
  // held and the rects read here already include that adjustment. Summing
  // the batch's growth and adding it to scrollTop then pays a second time for
  // what the engine already paid (probe: three rows +320 above the reader,
  // engine +960, hook +960 again), and classifying rows by their post-layout
  // rects reads a row native pushed under the fold as straddling (+320 more).
  // The residual against the row's last seen position is exact whatever the
  // engine did: nothing (WebKit), everything (Chromium holding this row), or
  // something else (Chromium holding a different row).
  //
  // Node-keyed like the height, and dropped with it when the node detaches.
  //
  // WHY THE RECORD IS NEVER STALE AGAINST THE READER'S OWN INPUT. The user's
  // scroll -- wheel, touch, key, scrollbar -- reaches the main thread's
  // scrollTop at the start of a rendering update, and its scroll event is
  // dispatched in that same update's scroll steps, BEFORE style, layout and
  // the ResizeObserver callbacks; every scroll event re-reads this record. So
  // by the time a fire reads rects, any user scroll those rects reflect has
  // already refreshed the record. What can change scrollTop between the
  // scroll steps and the fire is layout itself -- the engine's scroll
  // anchoring -- and that is exactly the part the residual must net out. An
  // earlier version guarded the fire with follow's hardware-input stamp
  // instead; a click or a key that scrolls nothing left the stamp newer than
  // the record forever and every later fire stood down (probe: click, wait
  // 2s, resize -- 1280px never paid), and a PageDown whose animation had not
  // yet moved scrollTop dropped the payment for a scroll that landed a frame
  // later. Neither input had moved the rows the record describes. A record
  // is invalid only when its row is gone (row identity: the node is no
  // longer mounted).
  //
  // Re-read at SCROLL EVENTS and seeds only, never at the end of a fire. A
  // scroll event is dispatched for the previous frame's position with layout
  // clean, so the rects read then are the frame the reader saw. A fire is
  // mid-frame: the observer delivers one layout's notifications over several
  // callbacks (the scroller's own box came alone, the rows an iteration
  // later, in the width probe), and every rect already shows the whole
  // reflow -- re-reading there would baseline the rows' fire on the reflowed
  // positions and measure no displacement at all (probe: the hook paid 0 of
  // 1280 with anchoring off). The fire's own write instead carries the record
