# Kiro Crew Desktop (Electron)

Desktop shell for the Kiro Crew web dashboard on macOS, Linux, and Windows. It
automatically starts `kirocrew gateway` and connects to `localhost:5476`.

## Quick Start

```bash
cd electron
npm install
npx electron .
```

The app will:

1. Reuse an existing gateway if one is already reachable and actually serving
   (`/api/ready` 200) — a gateway draining after `/api/shutdown` still answers
   `/api/status`, so it is never adopted; the app waits for the port to clear
   and spawns fresh instead. Before reusing a same-family gateway on a fixed-path
   POSIX install, the app detects whether its sole listener is an older gateway
   from the current bundled backend path. If so, it warns that updated features
   may be unavailable and offers Continue or Quit, with instructions to stop the
   old gateway before reopening the app. It does not restart or force-stop the
   gateway automatically. Remote tunnels, separate CLI installs, unknown owners,
   same or newer versions, Windows, and moved AppImages retain existing behavior
2. Launch `kirocrew gateway` when needed
3. Show a loading screen while the backend boots. A live bundled backend gets an
   extended Windows cold-start window; a child that actually exits still fails
   immediately with its launch-log cause.
4. Load the dashboard
5. Point the user at Kiro CLI installation and sign-in on the gateway host when
   either prerequisite is missing

The Electron shell uses the same gateway-hosted setup screen as every browser;
it has no separate installer or login runner, and it performs neither step. The
screen links out to <https://kiro.dev/cli/> for the CLI, and names the commands
the user runs to sign in: `kiro-cli login` for a personal account, or
`kiro-cli login --use-device-flow --license pro` for organization SSO. Both are
shown because the portal the bare command opens offers a free Builder ID
alongside organization SSO, and picking the wrong one still succeeds — the
mismatch only surfaces later as missing models. The app observes completion
through the read-only `kiro-cli whoami` probe. Candidate selection is
fail-closed: a broken higher-priority Kiro CLI is shown as needing repair and is
not skipped in favor of a later candidate. Remote tunnel sessions check the
remote gateway host.

## Main-process owners

`main.js` is the composition root. Between them, `main.js` and `ipc-registrar.js`
require four lifecycle facades (the updater is composed from `ipc-registrar.js`),
and each facade composes cohesive owners under `runtime/<area>/`:

| Facade (what `main.js` and `ipc-registrar.js` require) | Runtime owners it composes | What stays in the facade |
|---|---|---|
| `gateway-supervisor.js` (`createGatewaySupervisor`) | `runtime/gateway/launch-preflight.js` (backend binary, bundle completeness, project dir, sandbox-profile advice, launchd `PATH`, relaunch target) · `port-holders.js` (lsof/ps/netstat probes, trusted Windows gateway commands, incumbent snapshot and exit wait, force-stop) · `family-takeover.js` (quitting the other release family's app) · `token-sources.js` (the local-secret mint and the SSH token fetch) · `remote-crew-prompt.js` (the Add / Edit Remote Crew form) | All gateway state (child, ownership, start failure, liveness monitor, update handoff), the spawn site and its environment, every port occupancy and identity decision, the connect flow, the failure dialog, liveness recovery and shutdown |
| `window-lifecycle.js` (`createWindowLifecycle`) | `runtime/window/chrome.js` (traffic lights, title-bar overlay, native theme, zoom, focus-mode chrome) · `prompts.js` (New Connection Window port prompt, Rename Window) · `session-security.js` (session permission policy, microphone and screen-recording recovery dialogs) · `linux-captions.js` (frameless Linux caption controls) · `browser-panels.js` (per-window native browser panels and their agent command channel) | Window creation and state restore, the drag band, fullscreen handling, close-to-tray and every show path, the tray, the remote-host prompt, the menu, window-control admission, and the browser IPC routing |
| `auto-update.js` (`initAutoUpdate` and 15 policy exports) | `runtime/update/state-reporter.js` (channel, lane pair, lifecycle pushes, replayable info) · `feed-lane.js` (electron-updater discovery, download, staged install) · `managed-lane.js` (the marker-driven check and apply commands) | Channel and feed policy (`KNOWN_CHANNELS`, `channelHasLane`, `channelForVersion`, `buildFeedBase`, `manualDownloadUrl`), the update-policy flags, the `EXTERNALLY-MANAGED` marker reader and its caps, the narrowed marker-command `PATH`, the install-shape probes, and the gates that choose a lane |
| `crash-collector.js` (`armCrashCollector`, `collectCrashReports`, `crashNoticeSummary`) | `runtime/crash/ownership.js` · `artifact-parsers.js` · `candidates.js` · `persistence.js` · `scan.js` | The export surface and `crashNoticeSummary`, the one renderer-facing view |

Three rules keep this layout safe to change:

- Consumers require only the facades. Their export names, factory options,
  returned object shapes and module-scope constants are the contract. Many tests
  also read source text, so a pinned construct moves only together with its pin,
  and the pin reads the file that defines it: the facade for most, a runtime
  owner for a few (the managed lane's pinned shell, the browser panels' view
  wiring).
- A runtime owner never requires Electron, the facade, or `fs`/`os`/`path`/
  `http`/`child_process` where its facade injects them, and never resolves a
  path from its own `__dirname`: the Electron directory (`loading.html`, the
  preload, icons, the baked marker) is always the facade's.
- Every file is listed individually in `package.json` `build.files` and
  required with a double-quoted, extensionless, file-explicit path
  (`require("./runtime/gateway/port-holders")`, `require("../../gateway-stop")`).
  `test/shell-contract.test.js` fails on a required file missing from the
  allowlist, and `test/packaging.test.js` on a single-quoted or template-literal
  relative require, which the scans cannot read, or on an owner no facade
  composes.

## Install as macOS App

Build a native `.app` bundle and install to `/Applications`:

```bash
cd electron
npm install
npx electron-builder --mac --dir
APP_DIR=$([ "$(uname -m)" = "arm64" ] && echo "dist/mac-arm64" || echo "dist/mac")
sudo rm -rf /Applications/KiroCrew.app
sudo cp -R "$APP_DIR/KiroCrew.app" /Applications/KiroCrew.app
```

Launch via Spotlight (Cmd+Space → "KiroCrew"), Dock, or `open /Applications/KiroCrew.app`.
Right-click the Dock icon → Options → Keep in Dock to pin it.

## Build `.dmg`

```bash
npm run dist
```

Output goes to `electron/dist/`. The DMG opens to a branded 660×420 logical-size
drag-to-Applications layout on a flat light-purple ground carrying the opening
animation's white ghost cast, with one chevron pointing from the app to
`/Applications`.
Its background is a multi-resolution TIFF with 1× and Retina 2× representations.
The release workflow uses this Electron-built DMG as a layout template, removes
its unsigned app, and inserts the signed/stapled app before the DMG itself is
signed and notarized. That keeps local previews and shipped downloads aligned.

## Build Windows Installer (NSIS)

The Windows desktop build is wired end to end: `package.json` declares an
`nsis` target under `build.win`, and `packaging/build-desktop.sh` has a full
Windows branch. Run it from Git Bash (or MSYS/Cygwin — the script normalizes
those to `windows`) at the repo root:

```bash
bash packaging/build-desktop.sh
```

Notes:

- **The build must run natively on Windows**, not cross-built from macOS or
  Linux: the script provisions a Windows python-build-standalone interpreter
  via `uv` and executes its `python.exe` to install and verify the bundled
  backend, then runs `electron-builder --win` to produce the NSIS installer.
- **Signing is optional for a local build.** The `signtoolOptions.sign` hook
  (`scripts/sign-windows.js`) skips cleanly when none of the
  `WINDOWS_SIGNING_*` environment variables are set, so a credential-less
  build produces a working unsigned installer. (Setting only some of the five
  variables is treated as a misconfiguration and fails the build.)
- The result is an assisted (non-one-click, per-user) NSIS installer,
  `KiroCrew Setup <version>.exe` (nightly builds:
  `KiroCrew Nightly Setup <version>.exe`), in `website/electron/dist/`.
- The pinned electron-builder NSIS template is patched during `npm install` to
  expose Kiro Crew's staged-payload publish hook. On a normal same-volume
  per-user install it renames the large `resources` / `locales` trees into place
  and copies only the small root remainder; per-machine installs keep the
  upstream copy path so files inherit the Program Files ACL. Cross-volume or
  occupied destinations also retain the upstream copy-and-retry fallback. The
  Windows backend ships hash-based (unchecked)
  bytecode for the measured gateway import closure, so first launch consumes
  build-time caches rather than generating thousands of files under Defender.
  Unchecked rather than checked so the loader does not also re-read and re-hash
  every `.py` it imports, which cost a median 12.5 s per cold boot; macOS's
  whole-tree caches stay checked-hash.
- The native welcome/finish sidebar and the header used on intermediate pages
  carry the Kiro Crew logo and ghost artwork. The standard NSIS controls and
  localized instructions remain native. Page boundaries use a short Win32
  alpha-blended cross-fade that follows the system client-area animation setting;
  extraction itself stays on the native progress page without timer-driven art.
- A fresh install's native Finish page discloses that the default Kiro agent
  needs a separately installed and authenticated Kiro CLI, names `kiro-cli
  login`, and links to <https://kiro.dev/cli/>. It never runs either step.
  Auto-updates skip the Finish page and keep their existing automatic relaunch.

See `../../docs/guides/windows-install.md` for the CI-built installer and the
current Windows support status.

## Updating

After pulling new code and rebuilding (`npm run build`):

```bash
# Rebuild and reinstall the desktop app
cd electron && npx electron-builder --mac --dir
APP_DIR=$([ "$(uname -m)" = "arm64" ] && echo "dist/mac-arm64" || echo "dist/mac")
sudo rm -rf /Applications/KiroCrew.app
sudo cp -R "$APP_DIR/KiroCrew.app" /Applications/KiroCrew.app

# Restart the gateway (service-aware)
kirocrew restart
```

## Uninstall

```bash
# Remove the desktop app
sudo rm -rf /Applications/KiroCrew.app

# Stop and remove the managed gateway service, if installed
kirocrew service uninstall
```

## Remote Tunnel Mode (Headless CDE)

If the gateway runs on a remote dev desktop (the recommended setup per
`../../docs/guides/remote-and-mobile.md`), the app can fetch tokens automatically
via SSH instead of reading the local `.local_secret`.

### Prerequisites

1. An SSH tunnel forwarding the remote gateway port to localhost. Either tick
   **Keep an SSH tunnel to this crew open** for the app's launch port (in the
   Add/Edit Remote Crew form the "no gateway is answering" dialog opens, or in
   Set Remote Host… on that tab, below), and the app opens and maintains it;
   saving either form applies the choice at once. Or run your own:
   ```bash
   ssh -L 5476:localhost:5476 YOUR_HOST.example.com
   ```
   Or use a macOS LaunchAgent (see `../../docs/guides/assets/`).

2. `kirocrew` installed on the remote host. The default auto-discovers across common
   install layouts — no configuration needed unless you installed somewhere unusual.

### Configure

Remote host settings are **per-port** — each tab can have its own remote host
(or none, for local gateways). Focus the tab you want to configure, then use
**Tab menu → Set Remote Host…** or right-click the tab bar:

1. The modal shows which port it's configuring (e.g. "Remote host for :5476")
2. Enter your remote host's hostname or SSH config alias (e.g. `myhost.example.com` or `clouddesk`)
3. Leave the binary path at the default unless you installed kirocrew somewhere
   unusual. The default tries, in order:
   - `~/.toolbox/bin/kirocrew` (toolbox install — recommended)
   - `~/.local/bin/kirocrew` (install.sh / source install)
   - `~/.kirocrew-app/.venv/bin/kirocrew` (one-liner installer venv)
4. Optionally set a **Remote port** if the gateway port on the remote host differs
   from the local tab port (default: same as tab port)
5. Optionally set a **Remote PATH** if kirocrew needs additional directories
   (default: `~/.toolbox/bin:/usr/bin:/bin`)
6. Optionally tick **Keep an SSH tunnel to this crew open** (macOS and Linux).
   The app then runs `kirocrew desktop tunnel`, which holds the forward from the
   tab's port to the crew's with the same supervisor and backoff Remote Crew uses
   inside a gateway. A dropped forward is rebuilt on its own, and waking the
   machine from sleep rebuilds it at once. Leave it unticked if something else
   (your own ssh, a VPN, `kubectl port-forward`) already carries that port: the
   app never takes a port over without this opt-in. Routing and identity come
   from your `~/.ssh/config`, and ssh runs non-interactively, so the host must
   authenticate without a prompt.
7. Click Save. Leave hostname empty to clear (use local token for that port).

**Multi-instance example:**
- Tab 1 on `:5476` — local gateway, no remote host needed
- Tab 2 on `:7778` — SSH tunnel to another host, remote host configured

The app will SSH into the configured remote host and run `kirocrew token` on
each launch to get a fresh JWT — no manual paste required.

### Token flow (per tab)

```
1. Read `<data home>/run/gateway-<port>-<bind address>.secret` for the tab's port,
   trying the bind addresses whose listener answers the dialed v4 loopback
   (`127.0.0.1`, then `0.0.0.0`), then call `/api/token/local` on that port.
   The credential is keyed by the listener, so an entry belonging to a gateway on
   another address or another port is never read. No entry means refuse, not
   fall back: the home-wide `.local_secret` is not consulted here.
2. If remote host configured for this port:
   SSH: export PATH=<remotePath> KIROCREW_PORT=<port>; <bin> token
3. Fallback: show manual token prompt
```

### Menus

| Location | Item | Action |
|----------|------|--------|
| Connection menu (macOS) | New Window (⌘⇧N) | Open another dashboard window with a new blank session on the existing local gateway |
| Tab menu / tab bar right-click | Set Remote Host… | Configure hostname for the **focused tab's** port |
| Tab menu / tab bar right-click | Refresh Token (⌘⇧T) | Fetch a fresh token for the **focused tab** |
| Tab menu / tray | Open Config File | Open `config.json` in default editor |

### Tab naming

Tabs default to `[:port]`. You can set a **default name** per port via
**Rename Tab → ☑ Set as default name**. New tabs on that port will use it
automatically. Names are stored in `remoteHosts[port].defaultName`.

### Config file

Settings are persisted via `electron-store`. On macOS the file is
`~/Library/Application Support/KiroCrew/config.json`; on Linux and Windows, use
**Open Config File** to reveal the platform-specific application-data path:

```json
{
  "remoteHosts": {
    "5476": {
      "host": "myhost.example.com",
      "binPath": "~/.toolbox/bin/kirocrew",
      "remotePort": "",
      "remotePath": "",
      "defaultName": "Cloud"
    }
  },
  "sshTimeoutMs": 20000
}
```

Open via **Tab menu → Open Config File** or tray menu.

### Troubleshooting

| Issue | Fix |
|-------|-----|
| "SSH token fetch failed" | Check `ssh YOUR_HOST` works from Terminal |
| "kirocrew binary not found in any of …" | Install Kiro Crew through a [supported install path](../../docs/guides/install.md#install-paths), or set a custom path |
| "command not found: kiro-cli" | Set Remote PATH to include `~/.toolbox/bin` (default does this) |
| "command not found: dirname" | Remote PATH missing `/usr/bin` — reset to default or add it |
| Token fetched but 403 | Restart the remote gateway — `ssh host kirocrew restart` |
| Wrong tab refreshed | Focus the target tab first (use Tab menu, not tray) |

## Notes

- On macOS, **Connection → New Window** (⌘⇧N) opens an independent
  dashboard window and creates a blank session. It shares the running local
  gateway and authentication origin, but does not copy the current session,
  project, draft, or context.
- Closing the window hides to tray — right-click the tray icon or Cmd+Q to quit
- **GPU rendering.** Hardware acceleration is on by default.
  `KIROCREW_DISABLE_GPU=1` or `--disable-gpu` turns it off for a launch
  (`disable-gpu.js`). On Windows, if the GPU process dies before the dashboard
  has loaded, the app relaunches itself once with software rendering
  (`--in-process-gpu --use-angle=swiftshader`, never `--no-sandbox`) and keeps
  that setting for the current app version under `gpuSoftwareFallback` in
  `config.json`; a new version tries hardware rendering again once
  (`gpu-crash-fallback.js`). The software-mode boot drops the opt-in's
  `--disable-software-rasterizer` so `KIROCREW_DISABLE_GPU=1` cannot veto
  SwiftShader. Remove the key to retry hardware rendering sooner.
- External links open in your default browser
- Desktop leaves the child `PATH` unchanged; the gateway-side prerequisite
  service independently probes Kiro CLI's supported user-local, Homebrew,
  macOS app-bundle, and Windows MSI locations
