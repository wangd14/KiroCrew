/**
 * withGatewayAuth() and gatewayToken() cannot be exercised directly — index.js
 * requires "electron" at load time (`app`, `ipcMain`), which does not exist
 * outside a running Electron process. The behavioural claims are pinned as
 * source guards instead, the same pattern instanceSwitchRules.test.js uses for
 * the rest of this module.
 *
 * What these guard: a credential borrowed from the main window's ALREADY
 * -established session (see ../../mochi-session-token.js) must be delivered
 * as a `Cookie` header, never as `?token=`. The gateway's auth middleware
 * checks a query-delivered value against its 5-minute link-click `exp` claim,
 * which is almost always already in the past for a borrowed session
 * credential (its `exp` froze at the moment that session was ORIGINALLY
 * exchanged). Delivering it as `?token=` would validate for a few minutes
 * after app launch and then silently 401 forever — the same "pet never
 * appears" bug this file exists to fix, just delayed rather than prevented.
