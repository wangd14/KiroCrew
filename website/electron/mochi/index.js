/**
 * Reconcile the pet window against Mochi's enabled state, forever.
 *
 * A one-shot check at boot is not enough: enabling Mochi in the App Store has
 * to make the pet appear without restarting the shell (and disabling it has to
 * make the pet go away). The gateway does not broadcast app enable/disable over
 * the WebSocket today, so the shell polls.
 *
 * Polling is the deliberate trade: adding an `app_enabled` WS event would be
 * cleaner but means changing the apps framework, and this is one localhost
 * request every few seconds against a gateway in the same machine. Worth
 * revisiting if the framework ever grows that event.
 *
 * No state is tracked because both window operations are idempotent —
 * openPetWindow returns the existing window, closePetWindow no-ops when there
 * is none — so each tick can simply assert the desired end state.
 *
 * The cadence is ADAPTIVE, not fixed. The common steady state for anyone who
 * has not turned Mochi on (it ships defaultEnabled:false) is "disabled, and no
 * remote pet is keeping it alive" — a state a tick can neither change nor be
 * changed by until a human flips the App Store toggle. Polling that at a flat
 * 5s issues a `/api/apps` request forever and, on a gateway that answers 403
 * for a disabled app, logs a line every cycle. So once a tick
 * SETTLES on that state the loop backs off — doubling the delay from the base
 * up to a ceiling — and snaps straight back to the base cadence the moment any
 * tick reports something else (enabled, a remote pet, or an unreadable probe).
 * Backoff rather than a hard stop because this loop is the ONLY thing that
 * notices a re-enable without a shell restart (see the header above): a stop
 * would trade the log flood for a pet that never comes back until relaunch,
 * whereas a ceiling bounds the worst-case notice of a re-enable to one ceiling
 * interval while collapsing the steady-state cost to almost nothing.
