   * Node's "spawn" event only proves the exec succeeded: a bundle intact
   * enough to exec and broken enough to crash during initialization would
   * still take the app down. The handshake is therefore the successor's own
   * gateway answering on the port, and it carries that meaning only while the
   * port has nobody on it to begin with. That is checked here rather than
   * assumed: a gateway a separate install or a terminal launched answers exactly
   * like a successor would, and confirming on it would exit this instance on a
   * stranger's liveness. The test is whether ANY responder is there, not what it
   * says, because a gateway too old to serve the readiness endpoint is still a
   * gateway holding the port. So an occupied port abandons the handoff with this
   * instance untouched, and only a port that nothing answered on can confirm
   * one. An answer on such a port means the successor booted, ran its
   * supervisor, and started a serving backend. A 503 "starting" counts too: the
   * successor's gateway is bound and only still restoring sessions.
   *
   * What remains is a bind between the check and the successor's own bind. That
   * window is the spawn itself, and losing it costs a killed successor and a
   * surfaced failure rather than an app that exits into nothing, because the
   * check is what stands between a foreign gateway and `app.exit`.
   *
   * Which port carries that handshake belongs to the caller. A bundle upgrade
   * re-execs the same configuration, so the successor binds this process's own
   * port and inherits the environment that chose it. Turning the local gateway
   * back on does not: the successor would re-run port selection with the setting
   * now on, and an inherited `KIROCREW_PORT` outranks that selection, so the
   * successor could bind a port this process is not watching and be killed while
   * healthy. That caller therefore pins its chosen port into the successor's
   * environment, which makes the watched port and the bound port one value
   * instead of two answers that have to agree.
   *
   * Everything short of that is a failure with this instance still alive:
   * a spawn error (ENOENT on a pruned bundle), the successor exiting before
   * its gateway answered, or the bounded wait running out. The failure path
   * kills a successor that is still running so exactly one instance remains,
   * takes the single-instance lock back so a later manual launch still routes
   * here, and runs the caller's ordinary failure bookkeeping.
   *
   * The liveness monitor is stopped for the duration: were it to fire during
   * the handoff it would force-stop the port the successor's gateway is
   * binding. Mid-session the boot splash is put back first, since only it
   * renders status and the user would otherwise watch the window vanish
   * unannounced; a failed mid-session handoff then surfaces the failure
   * dialog itself, the way the monitor's recovery would have.

   *        reports a restart that never happened.
