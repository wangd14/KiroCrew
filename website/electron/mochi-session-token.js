/**
 * Borrow the gateway session the MAIN WINDOW already established, for
 * Mochi's poller — a plain Node process in the main process with no browser
 * session of its own.
 *
 * Two paths already cover how the shell gets a gateway credential: the local
 * secret (local-token.js, same machine) and an explicitly configured SSH
 * remote host (remote-token.js). Neither reaches a third topology: the
 * gateway and Electron are reachable over loopback-equivalent networking (a
 * WSL2 gateway and a Windows Electron shell, say) but sit on different
 * filesystems, so `os.homedir()` inside Electron never resolves to the
 * gateway's `.local_secret` — and there is nothing remote about the setup to
 * configure an SSH host for.
 *
 * The main window already authenticated — by whichever path worked for it —
 * the moment it first loaded successfully: the gateway's
 * token_auth_middleware sets an `mc_token_<port>` session cookie on that
 * response (httpOnly, hours-long `session_exp`; see
 * docs/system-specs/modules/security.md). This reads that cookie back out of
 * Electron's own cookie store so Mochi can present the SAME credential.
 *
 * FAILS CLOSED: a missing session/cookie API, an unparsable backendUrl, or no
 * matching cookie all resolve to "". This never mints or fabricates a
 * credential — it can only ever hand back one a genuine prior authentication
 * already produced, so an app that never authenticated stays unauthenticated.
 *
 * @param {{electronSession: {cookies: {get: Function}}, backendUrl: string}} deps
 * @returns {Promise<string>}

  // Deliberately the RAW port, and deliberately fail closed when it is empty.

  // `mc_token_<port>` is named by the GATEWAY, after the port the browser's Host
  // header carried -- and a browser omits a scheme's default port from `Host`,
  // so the gateway falls back to its OWN listen port there. Behind a tunnel that
  // listen port is the remote one, which this process cannot know. Resolving the
  // URL's default port would therefore name a cookie belonging to whichever
  // gateway last served that port, and cookies are host-scoped only, so such a
  // cookie is present in this jar. Borrowing it would hand one gateway's session
  // credential to another. A port the URL states is unambiguous; an absent one
  // is a guess, and this path declines to guess.
