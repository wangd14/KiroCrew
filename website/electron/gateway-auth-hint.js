// gateway-auth-hint.js — WHICH machine should the user act on?
//
// Pure logic only (mirrors instance-guard.js / gateway-recovery.js); the shell
// owns the page load and the port probe.
//
// PROBLEM: when the app cannot mint a dashboard token it shows a "Token
// Required" page telling the user to run `kirocrew token` "on your dev
// desktop". That instruction is CORRECT for the case it was written for — an
// `ssh -L <port>:localhost:<port>` forward, where the gateway lives on another
// machine, so the CLI must run THERE (it authenticates with that host's own
// .local_secret, and the token it prints is signed by that gateway, which is
// the gateway this app is talking to through the tunnel).
//
// What the page never said is WHY it is asking, or how to tell which machine
// "your dev desktop" means. Two very different situations produce the same
// page:
//
//   foreign — the port is held by a gateway that is not this app's: an SSH
//             forward to another host, or an externally-started gateway. Our
//             own .local_secret cannot mint against it (the secret is
//             per-data-home and regenerated at each gateway start), so the
//             command has to run on the machine that gateway runs on.
//   local   — the port is held by OUR own local gateway and the mint still
//             failed. Telling that user to go to a "dev desktop" is nonsense;
//             the machine to act on is this one.
//
// This module picks between them from facts the shell already has after the
// boot-time port-owner probe (see classifyPortOwner in gateway-stop.js).
