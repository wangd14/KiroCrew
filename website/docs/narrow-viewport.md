# Narrow-viewport recommendations

The measurement record behind Kiro Crew's narrow-viewport behaviour. Everything
here is a recommendation, not a gate — each one earned its place by breaking on a
real screen, and each carries the measurement that settled it, so reach for the
measurement before arguing with the rule.

The page skeleton, the inset budget and the "Do NOT" list a page author needs
first are in [page-layout.md](page-layout.md); this doc is the appendix it points
at.

## Layout and sizing

**A collapsed side rail becomes a horizontal bar across the TOP, never a thin vertical
strip.** Horizontal is the one axis a phone cannot spare; vertical it can. A 44px strip
overflows nothing, so it looks fixed while the reading column still pays for it.

**Hiding is not collapsing.** A control removed below `md` needs an entry point at that
width — an overflow menu, a drawer, a disclosure. A pane that hides the only host of the
phase-advance controls leaves the phone user unable to advance the phase at all.

**Gate on the constraint, not the viewport.** When a pane can be narrow at any viewport
(a split, a resizable rail, an embedded panel), measure the PANE with a `ResizeObserver`
rather than calling `useIsMobile()`. A 1280px window can hold a 200px pane.

**A tabbed shell's pane needs its own top inset once the header goes away — and it
must be the only one.** `SidePanelLayout` drops the desktop header block below `md` —
the block whose `pb-3` put 12px between a tab's title and its content — and replaces it
with a pill strip that ends in a drawn `border-b`. The pane kept no inset of its own, so
a tab whose first element is a `Card` or a `StatCard` rendered that element's own border
ON the divider: two lines touching, measured at a 0px gap on four of Customize's
seven tabs and on seven of Developer's eight renderable ones at 390px. The pane carries
`pt-3` on the narrow branch only — desktop must stay at 0 or the two insets stack.

That inset is shared by all three pages built on the shell (Customize,
Developer, Settings), which makes the second half of the rule as load-bearing as the
first: **a tab must not add a top margin to its own first element.** Doing so stacks on
the pane and lands that tab 28px down while its siblings sit at 12px — the inconsistency
reads as sloppiness precisely because the tabs are one keystroke apart. Two shapes, and
the difference is whether the heading can ever have a sibling above it:

- **A heading at the tab's root** (`SkillsTab`, `SteeringTab`) drops the margin outright.
  Do NOT reach for `first:mt-0` here: `SkillsTab` renders `PendingSkillsPanel` above the
  heading, and that panel returns `null` when nothing is pending — so the heading moves in
  and out of `:first-child` with the pending count, and a positional rule would make the
  gap depend on it. (A conditionally rendered `Modal` does NOT have this effect: it
  `createPortal`s to `document.body` and never occupies a sibling slot.)
- **A heading that repeats within one tab** (`SettingsSection`, used many times per
  Settings tab; `LocalStorageDebug`'s section headings) keeps `mt-6`, because the gap
  between two sections is real, and pairs it with `first:mt-0`. The fragment adds no DOM
  node, so every section header is a sibling in one parent and only the leading one
  matches — and when a tab renders something of its own above the first section, the
  header stops being first and correctly keeps the margin.

Measured at 390px with `website/scripts/capture-side-panel-pane-inset.mjs`, which reports
the divider→first-in-flow-box distance per tab: all 31 renderable tabs across the three
pages now read 12px. Residual differences in where the first *pixel* lands (21px on
Connections, on Developer > System, on Settings > Remote Crew) are a control's own internal
padding — a sub-tab's or a segmented button's tap target — not stacked page padding, and
tightening those would shrink a touch target.

**An unbounded action cluster leaves the text row; it does not shrink it.** A row of
actions whose count depends on state (enabled, updatable, uninstallable) and that carries
`shrink-0` takes its natural width, and the text column gets the remainder — measured at
34px on a 390px screen, and 0px at 320px. Move the cluster to its own row below the text.

**A per-character-breaking script collapses instead of overflowing, so overflow metrics
cannot see it.** CJK text reaches `scrollWidth == clientWidth` while wrapping to one or
two characters per line. Judge a reading column by its WIDTH, not by whether anything
overflowed.

**Two coupled numbers must be pinned by a test.** A negative margin that cancels an inset
(`-mx-2 md:mx-0` against `Card`'s own `px-2`), or a pull-back sized to a tile's width plus a
gap, is ONE number written twice. Changing one alone misaligns silently — nothing
overflows, so only a test that asserts the pair catches it.

**An icon alone cannot carry a state-changing action.** `aria-label` fixes the screen
reader, not the sighted user, who is left guessing what a bare glyph does. Icon-only is
for neutral, recoverable affordances (refresh, expand), not for a write.

**Verify at 320px, not only 390px.** 320 is the floor every major design system bottoms
out at, and it is where a layout that merely looks tight at 390 actually breaks — the
Apps card measured a 34px text column at 390px and 0px at 320px.

**Build touch targets to 44px; grade them in two tiers.** 44px is the number every system
recommends. WCAG 2.2 SC 2.5.8's floor is 24x24, but it carries a **spacing** exception: an
undersized target still conforms if a 24px circle centred on it does not intersect a
neighbour's. So under 24x24 *and* crowded is a conformance failure; under 44x44 alone is a
convention miss. Reporting every sub-44 control as a violation over-reports by roughly 3x.

**In a row of adjacent icon actions, width carries the margin; height may be 32.** The two
axes face different misses. Sideways, a finger that lands off-centre hits the *next*
action, so the glyph pitch (cell width, cells flush) is the safety distance. Vertically the
row has no neighbour — message text above, whitespace below — and touch browsers already
snap a near-miss onto the only tappable element nearby, so extra height buys nothing and
every completed turn pays for it. The message footers (`ICON_ACTION_ROW_CLS` in
`touchActions.ts`) are 36 wide x 32 high on touch for that reason, the same shape ChatGPT's
response-actions row uses (40 x 32); 32 clears the 24px floor. Width is also what keeps a
row on one line: six actions plus an en-US timestamp fit 390px at 36, and wrapped at 40.
The rule is for rows of icon-only actions; a hover-revealed lone button, or one carrying a
text label, keeps `HOVER_NONE_ACTION_BTN_CLS` / `HOVER_NONE_ACTIONS_ROW_CLS` and their 40px
square, and an always-visible icon control takes `mc-touch-hit` (next entry).

**An always-visible icon control gets its 44px from `mc-touch-hit`, not from padding.** The
`mc-touch-hit` / `mc-touch-hit-y` / `mc-touch-hit-end` classes (`index.css`, the block after
the `.scrollbar-overlay` coarse rule) add an invisible `::after` that extends only the hit
area to 44px on each axis where the control is smaller, so drawn size and layout do not
change; use them on header, top-bar and row kebabs, toggles and split-button segments (`-y`
for a segment with neighbours on both sides, `-end` for the last segment, which grows away
from its neighbour). `HOVER_NONE_*` stays the tool for hover-revealed action clusters, which
must first be forced visible under `hover: none` and then grow their real padding to 40px.
The predicate is `pointer: coarse` rather than `hover: none` because the hit area is about
pointer precision, and hover capability is a separate question. The `::after` cannot reach
past the nearest `overflow: hidden` ancestor, since a clipped part of a box is not
hit-testable, so a host inside such a wrapper must lift the clip under the same query.

**`overflow: hidden` on ANY ancestor kills `position: sticky` — use `overflow: clip`.**
Same family: a `transform` on an ancestor re-anchors `position: fixed` children, and
`align-self: start` is the most common silent sticky failure in flex and grid. A sticky
element also cannot escape its own parent's box, so a bar that must outlive a scrolling
sibling has to be that sibling's SIBLING, not its child.

**`100vh` resolves against the LARGE viewport.** A `100vh` panel overflows while the URL
bar is showing and its bottom controls fall off screen. Use `svh` for app shells, since it
does not reflow as the bar animates, and `dvh` only for surfaces that must track the exact
visible area (a chat container, a modal). Safe area is **padding, not size**:
`padding-bottom: env(safe-area-inset-bottom)`, which resolves to 0 without
`viewport-fit=cover`.

**The shell is an application, not a zoomable document — page zoom is off on touch.**
Pinching magnifies a `position: fixed` / `h-dvh` layout whose scrollers are all
*inner*, so there is no axis left to reach what the magnification pushed outside the
visual viewport: topbar, composer and drawer leave at once and only a second pinch
brings them back. Three mechanisms enforce it because no single one covers every
engine — `maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no` in `index.html` (Blink, Gecko), a root
`html { touch-action: pan-x pan-y }` under `@media (pointer: coarse)` in `index.css`
(Blink's pinch and double-tap paths), and cancelling Safari's `gesturestart` in
`utils/pageZoom.ts` (WebKit has ignored the viewport zoom keys for user gestures
since iOS 10). Pointer-fine devices are untouched: ctrl+wheel and the trackpad pinch
are a desktop convention this has no business changing.

The corollary is the part to get right. **A surface that must magnify owns its own
zoom — it does not ask for `pinch-zoom` back.** `touch-action` is intersected from
the hit-test target up to the root, so a descendant cannot re-grant a behaviour the
root withheld; declaring `touch-pinch-zoom` there buys a dead gesture, not a working
one.

**Count the surfaces this rule binds before believing it holds.** There are **three**
full-viewport magnify overlays — the image viewer (`Lightbox` in
`components/markdown/Lightbox.tsx`, exported through `MarkdownRenderer.tsx`), the
diagram viewer (`DiagramLightbox.tsx`), and the
screenshot viewer in `pages/AppDetailPage.tsx`. Each one needs its own gesture: a
diagram viewer without one is unmagnifiable by any gesture, because its content is
fit-scaled vector whose labels are smallest at exactly the state it opens in. Checking the
documented example is not enough — count the instances, because a rule reads as satisfied
when its example obeys it. All three viewers share `hooks/usePinchZoom.ts`
(contact tracking, focal anchoring, pan clamping), so a further such surface gets the
gesture by using the hook rather than by re-deriving the math. `touch-none` on the
transform target is what opts it out of the root's `pan-x pan-y`.

**A trackpad is a third input class, not a touchscreen.** A trackpad pinch emits no
pointer events at all, so it reaches none of the contact-tracking code: Blink
reports it as a `wheel` carrying `ctrlKey`, WebKit as
`gesturestart`/`gesturechange` carrying a **cumulative** `scale`. The hook claims
both, which is what gives a laptop — and `ctrl`+scroll on a mouse — the same
magnification a touchscreen gets from two fingers. Four constraints are
load-bearing and each is easy to get wrong:

- **`gesture*` binds only under `(pointer: fine)`.** The converse of "a trackpad
  pinch emits no pointer events" does not hold: a gesture event does not imply a
  trackpad. **iOS Safari fires `gesturestart`/`gesturechange` for a two-finger
  TOUCH pinch too**, and those fingers are already driving the contact-tracking
  path — so binding both on a touch device puts two independent formulas on one
  pinch and zooms twice. The media query keeps this an *additional* input path for
  pointing devices rather than a second one for touch. `wheel` is deliberately
  **not** gated: a coarse-pointer device can still carry a mouse. Absent
  `matchMedia` counts as coarse, because failing closed costs only a trackpad path
  on a platform that has none, while failing open restores the double zoom.

- **The listeners cannot be React props.** React attaches `wheel` at the root
  *passively*, so `preventDefault()` inside an `onWheel` prop is ignored and the
  browser page-zooms anyway. They are manual `addEventListener` calls with
  `{ passive: false }`.
- **They sit on `window` and gate on containment**, not on the element. A viewer's
  element ref is null until it opens, so an effect reading the element at mount
  would bind nothing. Containment is the **overlay**, not the transform target: the
  letterbox around a small image is visually the viewer, and letting a pinch there
  fall through page-zooms the whole app behind a viewer that looks unchanged.
- **Binding is gated on the consumer being in a zoomable state**, which carries two
  distinct costs. A non-passive listener makes the compositor wait on main-thread
  dispatch for *every* wheel event, so an always-mounted consumer would tax
  scrolling app-wide while its viewer is shut. And claiming a gesture the consumer
  ignores would suppress page zoom — which, on content that is **not** fit-scaled,
  genuinely does magnify. So a no-viewBox diagram binds nothing and keeps that
  fallback.
- **Only `ctrl`+wheel is claimed.** A plain wheel belongs to whatever scroller owns
  it, which is what a no-viewBox diagram depends on to reach its edges.

And note why page zoom is not a substitute for any of this: a fit-to-viewport
surface is *invariant* under page zoom. At 200% the viewport's CSS-pixel width
halves, the `fixed inset-0` box halves with it, and the content re-fits to the
smaller box while each CSS pixel covers two device pixels — the two cancel, and the
labels come out the same apparent size.

The guard that enforces this sweeps **both** `components/**` and `pages/**`, because
a magnify overlay can live in either and a population scoped to one directory counts
instances of a set it has itself narrowed. All three viewers now satisfy the hook
requirement directly. `AppDetailPage.screenshotLightbox.zoom.test.tsx` separately pins
the screenshot viewer's reconciliation with arrow-key navigation, paging, and
click-to-dismiss — the prev/next seam the other two do not have.

Code blocks (`CodeBlock.tsx`) and markdown tables (the scroll wrapper in
`components/markdown/MarkdownTable.tsx`) take the other legitimate route and
scroll horizontally instead. And note what is *not* lost — the OS Display Zoom setting sits
outside the viewport contract and still magnifies anything. A browser tab's own
text-size control does too, but it is **not** a fallback in the installed app: a
standalone PWA has no Safari toolbar to reach it from, so on a home-screen install
Display Zoom is the only route. State it with that qualification everywhere the
claim appears (`website/index.html`, `docs/guides/remote-and-mobile.md`) — an
unqualified version points a low-vision user at a control that is not there.

**Any touch input below 16px zooms the viewport on focus, and WebKit does not zoom
back out.** The scale is `clampTo(16 / fontSize, minimumScale, maximumScale)` from the
FIELD's computed size, so a `text-sm` field can leave the user zoomed in — and with
page zoom off there is no pinch-out to undo it. **There is deliberately no app-wide
floor for this, and adding one needs evidence from a real device first**, because CSS
cannot express a floor at all: it can only SET a
size, so the two available shapes are wrong in opposite directions. A rule broad
enough to reach every field SHRINKS the ones that are deliberately larger — measured,
not hypothetical: `input:not([type=…]):not([type=…])` is (0,2,1) and beat the artifact
rename field's `text-2xl`, snapping a 24px title to 16px on a phone. A narrower
selector list misses fields instead, because a size can arrive as a named utility, an
arbitrary value (`text-[13px]`), an `!important` modifier or an inline style, and no
list contains the next one. A guard test rescues neither shape: ~120 of this app's
fields are routed through the `<Input>` primitive or the `useAutoGrowTextarea`
hook rather than a native tag, so a source sweep for `<input>` cannot see them and
reports green.

Two things make withholding the floor the safer side of that trade. The focus zoom is
**pre-existing** — it is not introduced by suppressing pinch, which removes only the
recovery gesture — and whether it can fire at all once `maximum-scale=1` is authored
depends on the same engine path that decides whether WebKit honours the viewport keys,
which is not answerable from source. Settle it on a device; if it does fire, the fix
belongs in the field components, where a real `max(16px, authored)` is expressible.

**The `meta-viewport` axe rule is left ENABLED, deliberately.** `@axe-core/react` scans
every render, so `user-scalable=no` reports a critical WCAG 1.4.4 finding on every scan.
A waiver for it was written and removed; do not re-add one. The argument for waiving was
that a permanent finding nobody can action trains contributors to ignore the console —
but the finding *is* actionable, because it is a decision, and a decision does not stop
being owed because a scanner keeps asking for it. That recurring report is currently the
only automated reminder that suppressing page zoom is an accessibility trade with no
in-app text-size control substituting for it. Revisit the waiver only once that decision
is recorded, and then record the decision rather than the silence.

**Use the line-length cap in reverse to tell "ugly" from "broken".** WCAG 1.4.8 caps a
reading measure at 80 characters, 40 for CJK. Run it backwards and a squeezed pane stops
being a matter of taste: a 50px column at 13px holds three CJK glyphs, which is a defect
you can state as a number.

**Reach for a `Card` less often on a phone.** A card buys grouping with a drawn border
plus its own inset — on a 390px screen that is 16px of width and a line the screen edge
already implies. Where a section is the only thing on the page, or where the grouping is
already obvious from a heading, prefer a heading plus content and let the page gutter do
the work. Cards earn their keep when several peer groups must be told apart on one
screen; they cost the most when they are nested, since each level charges its inset
again.

**An overflowing action row belongs in an overflow menu — not wrapped, not silently
scrolled.** This is the one place the design systems are unanimous (Primer's `ActionBar`,
Carbon's five-action cap, Apple's "define which items move to the overflow menu"), and it
is what `AUTOSDE.yaml`'s `max-two-buttons-per-row` encodes. Wrapping such a row below `md`
keeps the controls reachable, but it is an interim, not the answer.

## The phone chat page has ONE top bar

Below `md` the chat route used to stack two bars: the shell's (logo -> nav drawer,
search square, readout capsule, bell) over the page's own title row (sessions
toggle, title, pop-out, activity panel). Two bars cost 84px of a 844px screen for
chrome and offered a phone user two drawers for one gesture. There is now one bar,
the shell's, and the chat page fills it:

| cell | who renders it | what is in it |
|---|---|---|
| leading (`auto`) | `App.tsx` | the crew switcher (when a remote crew exists) and downstream widgets (while they exist); usually empty. Not the update pill: beside a remote crew's chip + dropdown it was a third action, so on this page a pending update is the first item of the overflow menu (`UpdatePill variant="menu-item"`, same lifecycle label) |
| centre (`minmax(0,1fr)`) | `ChatPage.tsx` through `pages/chat/page/MobileTopBar.tsx`, by `createPortal` into `#mobile-topbar-slot` | sessions toggle, then ONE control that is the session title with the menu chevron flush after it (`ChatHeaderMenu` `triggerLabel`); Rename and Auto-title are items of that menu (`SessionActionsMenu` `onRename` / `onAutoTitle`), and Rename swaps in the shared title editor. That menu leaves out its pop-out / focus-popped-out rows here (`omitPopout`): the trailing ⋯ menu is the phone's window menu and carries them, and the same row in two adjacent menus read as two different actions. Nothing else: the inline row's Autopilot InfoTip and `InboundLinkChip` would each be a third control, so the mode is read from the session menu's Autopilot row and a two-way link's actions from its Linked surfaces section |
| trailing (`auto`, `.tb-trail`) | `App.tsx`, plus the same `MobileTopBar`'s portal into `#mobile-topbar-trail-slot` | exactly two: the bell, then the page's overflow menu (update when pending, pop out or focus the popped-out window, activity panel, split view). The update row reads `<status> — Open update settings`: a menu row is read as an action, and the row only navigates to Settings › About, so it names that outcome instead of implying a download or restart. The update row is a lazy chunk inside its own `ErrorBoundary`, so a chunk that fails to load costs the row, not the page (a rejection would otherwise reach the route boundary); the fallback is an inline `ErrorNotice` plus its `ErrorNoticeMenuItem` hand-off (`errors-use-error-notice`), never `null`, because this menu is the update's only phone home and a silent gap would hide the failure |

That is the `topbar-single` header variant (`index.css`), applied only while
`isMobile && isChat`. **Its side cells are plain flex divs, not `.tb-left` /
`.tb-right`.** Those two are inline-size containers for the collapse ladders, and
a size container in an `auto` track has no content size to give, so it collapses
to its padding and clips its contents -- the measurement is recorded in
`test/topbarMenuButtonNarrow.test.ts`, and `test/topbarSingleVariant.test.ts`
pins that no container class reaches the variant's side cells. The single bar
has no ladder to run (the readout capsule is not rendered on it), so it needs no
containers. `.tb-trail` keeps `.tb-right`'s padding/negative-margin pair for the
bell badge's 4px overhang.

The hand-off is the same shape as the desktop activity panel's `#activity-bar-slot`:
the page resolves the slot element with `useShellSlot` (lazy initialiser plus a
MutationObserver for the breakpoint-crossing case), and derives "the row is in the
bar" from the ELEMENT, never from `isMobile` -- the two can disagree for a render on
a crossing, and the inline row, the fixed corner sessions button, the transcript's
64px header spacer and the split view's inline toggle all key off that one flag so
the row is in exactly one place. Where the shell renders no slot (the popout
window, an embedded host, a desktop width) the page keeps its inline row: a missing
target degrades to yesterday's layout, never to no title.

**What left the bar, and where it went.** The readout capsule (connection dot,
metrics, credits) is not rendered on the phone at all: a phone user does not act on
a resource readout, and the bar's right side holds two controls (bell + overflow
menu) by the max-two-buttons-per-row rule. The capsule's one generic job -- the
dot turning red on a transport drop -- is taken by `mobile-offline-strip`: a 24px
`Gateway offline -- reconnecting` strip hanging off the bar (absolute, so the
header's three-child invariant holds), rendered while `isMobile && !connected &&
!authRequired`, `pointer-events-none` because it hangs over the top 24px of whatever
`<main>` paints. Auth expiry keeps its own banner from `api/client.ts`, so the strip
stays quiet then rather than pointing at the transport when pasting a token is the
fix -- visibly: the banner has no live region and the capsule's sr-only carrier is not
rendered on the phone, so an sr-only `role="status"` span (`mobile-offline-sr`) announces
the auth-specific cause. `App.mobileSingleTopbar.test.tsx` pins both states. The search square moved off the bar into the two phone drawers, same
label, same command palette: the chat drawer's rail pins it at the foot (below), and
the nav drawer carries it as a row in its bottom group, so every non-chat phone page
still reaches it. The capsule's credits segment is also the desktop's door to the
account modal (balance, sign-in state, `KiroAccountModal`), so the same two drawers
carry a **Kiro Account** entry -- a row in the nav drawer's bottom group and a tile
in the chat drawer's rail, both between Capabilities and Settings, both opening the
modal. On the Kiro backend it is always there (the modal's Refresh fills an empty
reading); on any other harness only for a reading the desktop segment would show --
`kiroAccountEntry = kiroCreditSurface || (reading !== null && !pillHidden)`, the
segment's own derivation minus the warming `null`, where the desktop's spinner would
become a nav row blinking in and out. Same test file pins both states.
Off the chat route the phone header keeps the logo -> nav drawer
and the bell, and renders an empty centre spacer so the header still has three
in-flow children -- with two, the actions group would be auto-placed into the `auto`
centre track and collapse.

**The chat page's ONE drawer carries the main navigation.** Its sessions
`OverlayDrawer` (unchanged width, slide, scrim, keyboard inset and Back handling)
now holds a 72px icon rail on the left -- the shell's, rendered by `App.tsx` and
handed down through `MobileNavRailContext` -- beside the sessions pane. The rail is
built from the same registry as the desktop rail (`advertisedNavItems`,
`sortedAppGroup`, the Bottom group) through the same `NavItem`, with `touch` for a
64x56 `rounded-xl` tile carrying a 10px caption under the glyph (a finger cannot summon
the desktop rail's hover tip), a full-opacity muted glyph (the desktop rail's 70% dimming
measured 3.4:1 on these flat tiles) and the desktop rail's selected paint, on a
`bg-bg-accent` surface that reads apart from the `bg-bg-elevated` pane. The brand mark on
top is the "home" control (chat root; a cold reader tapped it expecting that), named `Home`
(`nav.home`) for what it does rather than for the brand it shows; Search is pinned at
its foot, captioned `Search all` (`nav.search_short`) because it sits one pane away from the
sessions pane's "Search sessions..." field and a reader could not tell the two apart. Because the drawer minted a duplicate history entry on open
(`pushDrawerEntry`), rows behave in two ways: the row for the page the user is on
only closes the drawer, and a row that leaves the page navigates with `replace`
so Back returns to the chat rather than to a second copy of it. The shell's nav
drawer has no trigger on this route and its header swipe is gated off
(`useDrawerSwipe(shellRef, { enabled: isMobile && !isChat })`); the chat
container already claims its own swipe via `data-owns-swipe`.

## A horizontal drag on mobile belongs to the nav drawer unless a page claims it

The mobile nav drawer is bound app-wide: **one** `useDrawerSwipe` on the shell
(`[data-testid="dashboard-shell"]`), so a rightward drag opens it and a leftward one
closes it on every routed page, including surfaces that know nothing about it. The
root is the SHELL, not `<main>` — the drawer's panel and scrim are `fixed`
**siblings** of `<main>`, so an instance rooted there can open the drawer but never
receives the touch that should close it: the finger lands on the scrim, and the
listener is on an element the scrim is not inside.

**A page with its own horizontal drawer must claim the sides it owns**, or two
instances arm on one touch and fight for the same direction. Put
`data-owns-swipe` on the element the page binds its OWN gesture to, listing the
sides — `"left"`, `"right"`, or both space-separated:

```tsx
<div ref={chatContainerRef} data-owns-swipe="left right">
```

`side` here is the edge a panel is ANCHORED to, matching `useDrawerSwipe`'s own
option: a left-anchored drawer opens on a rightward drag.

The hook walks from the touch target up to but **not including** its own root, which
is what lets one attribute serve both instances — the claim is strictly below the
shell (so the app-wide instance stands down) and IS the page instance's own root (so
the page proceeds). Put the attribute anywhere else and one of the two breaks
silently: on a descendant, the page suppresses its own drawer; on an ancestor, the
app-wide instance never sees it.

**The mechanism fails OPEN.** No attribute means the app-wide gesture works, so a page
that forgets to declare gets a visible conflict. The inverse default would let one
missing attribute kill the gesture dashboard-wide with nothing to see.

**Which is why the claim must track what is actually BOUND, not the page.** A claim
that outlives its ownership defeats that default from the one place that declares.
The chat page binds nothing when `embedded` — and an embedded chat renders *inside*
the shell at full width on mobile (the artifact companion, the Papyrus co-author
panel, an app SDK panel), so an unconditional claim there suppressed the nav swipe
while serving nothing: a dead gesture across the whole screen, on the chat-shaped
surface where a user is most likely to try it. Gate the attribute on the same
condition as the bindings:

```tsx
data-owns-swipe={embedded ? undefined : 'left right'}
```

Two kinds of surface need no attribute, and it is worth knowing why rather than
copying:

- **Anything portaled to `document.body`** is outside the shell entirely, so the
  gesture cannot reach it. That covers `Modal`, the notification sheet, and the
  collapsed-rail tooltips. A static read of the JSX suggests otherwise — the sheet is
  written inside the topbar — so check for `createPortal` before concluding a surface
  is inside the shell.
- **Content that scrolls horizontally** already claims the gesture by being
  scrollable: the hook defers to the nearest horizontally-scrollable ancestor
  **outright**, whatever its scroll position. Wide code blocks, markdown tables
  (`components/markdown/MarkdownTable.tsx`) and diagram strips (the Mermaid host in
  `components/markdown/MermaidBlock.tsx`) need nothing declared. The deference is deliberately not the
  nested-scroll handoff you would give a scrollable PARENT — deferring only while
  the inner scroller still had somewhere to go meant a freshly rendered code block,
  which sits at `scrollLeft: 0`, handed the very first rightward drag to the drawer
  instead of scrolling the code. An element with nothing to scroll (content that
  fits) owns no axis, so the drawer is still reachable over it.

  **The search crosses shadow boundaries, via `composedPath()`.** `e.target` read
  from a listener outside a shadow root is retargeted to the HOST, so walking
  `parentElement` from it never sees a scroller inside the root — and that is not a
  corner case: a *finished* chat code block renders through `@pierre/diffs`, whose
  `diffs-container` is a web component carrying the `overflow` on an element in its
  shadow root. Read from the outside, such a block looks scroller-less and the drawer
  took every drag over it. Testing this needs a fixture that dispatches on the host
  with a real `composedPath()`; dispatching straight at the inner node leaves
  `e.target` inside the root, where a plain parent walk also finds the scroller, and
  the test cannot fail.

**A locked gesture takes the page's own handling away, and only then.** The four touch
listeners are `passive: true`, which is what keeps a touch that never becomes a gesture
on the browser's scroll fast path; the price is that a passive listener may not
`preventDefault()`, so the page kept scrolling vertically under the moving drawer and
fired a click on release. Both are suppressed from the moment the gesture LOCKS — a
non-passive `touchmove` added then governs the rest of the gesture, plus a one-shot
capture-phase `click` swallower for the release, both on `window` and both released when
the gesture ends. The click swallower is not redundant with `preventDefault`: a touch
that BEGAN on a button and then moved still fires its click. A suppression that has ENDED
is a different thing wearing the same slot — parked only to eat the release's click, with
its touchmove listener already removed — so a new gesture must release it and install a
fresh one rather than inheriting it. That window is ~350ms, which is exactly the
"swipe shut, swipe straight back open" beat, so inheriting it left the second of two
quick drags with no scroll suppression at all. It is also released as soon as a NEW touch
begins, because a fresh finger means any pending click belongs to that touch — without
which the swallower eats a genuine tap in the COMMON case rather than a rare one: a drag
over non-interactive content has its synthetic click suppressed by `preventDefault()`
already, so nothing arrives to disarm the swallower, it stays armed for the full window,
and the next real tap is the one it swallows — right on this feature's core beat, swipe
the drawer open and immediately tap something in it.

**Ownership is declined, never contested: the browser decides first.** It commits a
touch to a scroller earlier than this hook's axis lock does and by its own rule, and
once it has, nothing takes the touch back — `preventDefault()` is ignored. A diagonal
drag is where the two rules disagreed: a dy just under dx passed the "is this vertical?"
test while dy alone had already started a scroll, so the drawer arrived to find the page
moving under it. So a gesture whose vertical drift reaches `PLATFORM_SCROLL_SLOP` (8px,
deliberately below the 10px axis lock) is abandoned rather than fought for. Reading the
platform's own answer instead — an engine marks a touchmove non-cancelable once it owns
the touch — is **not** safe to act on: `cancelable` is false by default on a synthetic
event and is not guaranteed true for an ordinary touchmove delivered to a passive
listener, and a false reading abandons every gesture. A displacement threshold is
engine-independent and fails toward keeping the gesture.

**The gesture reads the state the panel is COMMITTED to, not the `open` prop.** The
consumer learns a new state from `onSettle`, which runs in the settle animation's
completion callback, so for the whole ~200-300ms of a closing slide the prop still says
open. A gesture starting in that window judged its direction against a panel that was
already leaving — a re-opening drag read as an opening drag on an open panel and was
declined — so swiping the drawer shut and immediately swiping it back open failed for as
long as the settle ran, intermittently and with the direction perfectly clean. A settle
therefore commits its own target the moment it starts, and the prop is adopted when it
CHANGES, which is the authority for a panel opened by tap rather than by gesture. Both
halves are load-bearing: without the first, re-opening is declined; without the second, a
hamburger-opened drawer cannot be dragged shut.

**A MODAL LAYER owns every touch inside it, read from its `role`.** A dialog is not
necessarily portaled out of the shell: the changelog and update-error overlays are plain
`fixed inset-0` JSX inside it (the shell element spans `App.tsx` 2635-3878, and both sit
between), so a horizontal drag across one pulled the nav drawer out BEHIND the dialog.
The hook therefore stands down for any `role="dialog"` / `role="alertdialog"` in the
chain. Read as a rule rather than a list of overlays, because `src/` declares dozens of
dialogs and a list means the next one silently fights the drawer — the same reasoning as
the `touch-action` rule below. Only those two roles count: treating any `role` as
ownership would hand away most of the page.

**A drag WIDGET needs no attribute either, because `touch-action: none` already says
so.** Sliders, resize handles, column splitters and pinch-zoom canvases are not
horizontally scrollable, so the scroller deference does not cover them — and they run
on POINTER events, whose `preventDefault` does NOT stop the touch stream from reaching
a listener on an ancestor. The hook therefore also yields to any element in the chain
whose computed `touch-action` is `none`, which is the platform's own declaration that
the element took touch handling from the browser. Only a full `none` counts: the root
sets `pan-x pan-y` under a coarse pointer to switch page zoom off, and treating that as
ownership would kill the gesture everywhere.

Reading the property is what keeps this from being a list that goes stale. There are
around a dozen such widget families in `src/` today (`ResizeHandle`, `ColumnSplitter`,
`BottomTerminalPanel`, `SessionGridLayout`, `DiagramLightbox`, the `Slider` in
`components/ui.tsx`, …); asking each to remember an attribute means the next one
silently fights the nav drawer instead.

**Count the panels before believing the rule holds.** Four are driven by
`registerDrawerTargets` today: the nav drawer, the chat page's sessions drawer and
activity panel (all three with gestures), and the notification sheet (no gesture,
portaled). Only the chat page declares a claim, because it is the only one that binds
its own gesture inside the shell.

**Two sibling instances exclude each other on INTENT, not on arrival.** The chat page
binds `useDrawerSwipe` twice on one element — sessions drawer on the left, side panel on
the right. While both are closed, DIRECTION separates them: each rejects the drag that
would open the other. Once one is open it cannot, because that panel's closing drag is
the other's opening drag, so each instance is `enabled` only while its sibling is not
open.

Spell that gate as `phase !== 'open'`, never `phase === 'closed'`, and give the consumer
the release decision through `onCommit` rather than `onSettle`. `onSettle` deliberately
waits for the settle animation so a consumer cannot unmount a panel mid-slide, which
makes it the wrong signal for a gate: keyed on arrival, the exclusion stayed shut for the
whole ~300ms slide, so a swipe that dismissed one panel could not be followed straight
away by a swipe revealing the other — the user had to wait out an animation they had
already finished driving. The hazard lasts exactly as long as the sibling is OPEN.

A committed close therefore parks the phase at `'closing'`, not `'closed'`: the panel is
still on screen and its mount predicate keys on `!== 'closed'`, so writing `'closed'`
here would cut the slide short. That also matches what a tap-driven close already did,
which is why the chrome derived from the phase does not change timing.

## A panel that gains a gesture must be bound LIVE to its offset

A panel moved only by a tap may serialize its offset at render time —
`style={{ transform: \`translate3d(${x.get()}px, 0, 0)\` }}` — because `animateDrawer`
writes the arrival into the element's own inline style. The notification sheet still
does this, correctly.

**The moment that panel gains a drag, that form is wrong**, and the failure looks
like a feel problem rather than a bug: a MotionValue deliberately does not re-render
React, so the drag writes the value every frame while the DOM moves only on whatever
re-render happens to occur — the panel comes out a little, freezes, and completes on
release when the settle takes over. Bind it instead, as all three gesture-driven
panels do:

```tsx
<motion.nav style={{ x: mobileNavX }}>
```

Framer and the compositor settle coexist on one element, because `takeOverDrawer`
adopts and cancels whatever is running before either writes. A scrim has the same
requirement in its other half: derive its opacity from the offset (over the drawer's
OWN travel, so the dim reaches 0 exactly as the panel clears the edge) rather than
holding a literal, or it cannot dim with the finger.

## Horizontal insets below the breakpoint

Padding stacks, and the eye reads the SUM. On a wide viewport a page gutter plus a card
inset plus a row inset is comfortable; at 390px it is not. The skill-budget row measured
16px (page) + 20px (`Card`) + 16px (row) = **52px** before its text, against 16px for the
same text in chat.

The page container keeps the `px-4 md:px-6 pb-8` the page skeleton recommends, and it is
not the layer to change. `AUTOSDE.yaml`'s `page-layout-pattern` requires the STRUCTURE --
`overflow-y-auto flex-1 min-h-0` plus some horizontal gutter -- and states that the narrow
gutter shown there is a recommendation, so a page holding one gutter value at every width
is conformant. The third layer is the one to drop:

**Below `md`, prefer no horizontal padding on a row that is a DIRECT child of a `Card`.**
The page gutter and the card's own inset already supply it:

```tsx
<div className="… py-2 md:px-4">   {/* row: the card supplies the inset while narrow */}
```

Gate **every** row in that card the same way -- section header, group header, data row,
footnote. Gating only some of them leaves the data rows sitting to the left of the headers
that label them, which reads as rows escaping their own section.

**The direct-child part is the precondition, not a detail.** The rule works because the
card is what supplies the inset the row gives up. Put an unpadded bordered pane between
them and that stops being true:

```tsx
<Card>                                                   {/* 20px */}
  <div className="… border border-border rounded-md">    {/* 0px, draws a visible edge */}
    <div className="… px-4 py-2.5 border-b">             {/* row: px-4 is its ONLY gutter */}
```

Here the row's `px-4` is load-bearing -- gating it puts the text flush against the border.
The excess inset belongs to the card, but the card is NOT what yields: halve the card's inset
below `md` and pull the pane out by exactly that amount, on the shell the pane and its
loading skeleton share so the layout does not jump when data arrives. The two numbers
are ONE number -- changing the inset without the margin pushes the pane past the border:

```tsx
const PANE_SHELL_CLASS = 'flex gap-3 -mx-2 md:mx-0 …'  /* cancels `Card`'s own px-2 */
```

From the boxes at 390px on the Skills tab: the pane goes from left 25 / width 340 to
left 17 / width 356, so a row inside it starts at ~34px instead of ~42px, against 16px
for the same text in chat. (The pattern was first measured on a page that ran a 16px
gutter and a 20px card inset, where the same pull-back moved the pane from left 37 /
width 316 to left 17 / width 356.)

**Do not flush the card itself** (a `px-0` override). Its padding is also the only gutter the
toolbar above the pane has, and removing it puts the search field's rounded border
directly against the card's border -- measured as a 0px gap, and the first thing a reader
calls ugly. `Card`'s own narrow inset (`px-2`, 8px) keeps the field off the border
while giving the row back most of the width. An inset toolbar above a full-bleed list is the ordinary phone pattern; the
two do not need to share a left edge.

This does not touch the page container's `px-4 md:px-6 pb-8`, which is what `AUTOSDE.yaml`'s
`page-layout-pattern` names and is not the layer to change. For a pane that must reach the
SCREEN edge, past the page gutter, cancel the gutter itself inside the pane (`-mx-3` while
narrow) -- the same one-number-written-twice pairing, so pin it with a test.

**This is a direction, not a description of the repo.** `SkillContextBudget`
(direct-child rows) and the `SkillsTab` / `SteeringTab` split panes (card flush) carry the
shape. A scan for `className="…px-4…py-2"` under `website/src/pages` matches ~27 rows
across 15 files, but a hit is not a work item: most are toolbars, banners, sticky bars and
buttons that own the only gutter their content has, and rows inside a bordered pane must
keep theirs. There is no lint gate for this, so read the structure around a hit before
gating it.


### Member memory drill-in

A named member Memory view owns its compact identity header and one back action.
`SettingsPage` opts into `SidePanelLayout.paneOwnsHeader` only for
`/settings/overview?view=memory&store=<named-store>`. The shell yields its duplicate
title, description and mobile back bar to that pane; Global V1 and other settings
retain their existing chrome. The picker updates router search parameters, so
this ownership follows selection and reload. The member workspace uses separate
Memories, Profile and Recovery sections; profile drafts remain mounted while
hidden. `MemoryTab` publishes unsaved state through `useSidePanelLeaveGuard` and
`beforeunload`, and the Overview back action uses `useGuardedLeave`.


Member memory identity uses the same `CrewAvatar` as the member roster, including
pinned ghost traits and uploaded pictures. `SimpleSelect.optionIcons` decorates
desktop choices while keeping their accessible labels and text typeahead. On
touch devices the selected avatar sits beside the native select; native options
remain text so long lists retain reliable platform scrolling.

The shared V1/V2 `MemoryRecordsEditor` renders one server page of 50 records.
Text search and memory-type filters cover the entire store; individual selections retain
record revisions across pages, while an all-matching selection freezes its query
and records explicit exclusions. Search controls lock only for all-matching
selection, making the batch scope visible on mobile. The toolbar wraps, card
previews clamp to three lines, and details show full text and revision proposals.
Preview dialogs stack before/after columns on narrow screens and keep application
behind a separate explicit action. A stale preview preserves typed input and
refreshes selected identities; an uncertain apply retries the same signed token.
Selection and draft state participate in the store, shell and browser leave guard.
Refreshing all-matching selections asks the server to count the frozen query with
its exclusions again; removed or nonmatching exclusions never reduce the count
twice. An empty refreshed scope can still be cleared. A missing single record
keeps its correction draft and retry action until that identity becomes available
again, at which point preview uses its new revision.

Pending revision proposals offer both adoption and keeping the current value.
Keeping the current value prepares a versioned review preview directly; its
resolution notice explains why identical before/after content still requires an
explicit apply. Historical proposals whose base revision no longer matches the
server's current revision remain readable without pending-action buttons.
History loads in pages of 25 inside the same details view. A failed later page
keeps earlier revisions visible and retries that page; overlapping revision IDs
are displayed only once if the history changes during review.

Desktop and mobile detail views in `SidePanelLayout` share one mounted pane
ancestry. Crossing the viewport breakpoint only changes chrome and spacing;
it must not remount an editor or lose its selection, draft, or signed preview.
The mobile root list still has no pane: returning to that list is an intentional
navigation through the existing leave guard. Regression coverage resizes the
shared memory editor in both directions with a reviewed batch waiting to apply.
