"""Drive a harness through ``/compact`` and MEASURE whether its context shrank.

``ACP_BACKENDS_COMPACT`` in ``src/kiro_crew/agent_sdk/backends.py`` admits a harness
on a DRIVEN capture rather than on its source: the bar opencode and goose met is a live
session whose ``usage_update.used`` was seen to fall below its pre-compact peak. pi
finishes a compaction inline according to its own code and is not a member, because
nobody had driven it -- it answered ``Authentication required`` where that note was
written.

This script is that drive, as one command. It spawns the harness the way Crew spawns
it, sends N ordinary turns, sends ``/compact``, sends one more ordinary turn, and
prints the ``used`` series with a verdict. The JSONL it writes is the evidence a
membership rests on, in the corpus's own fixture shape.

    python3 scripts/capture_acp_compaction.py --harness goose
    python3 scripts/capture_acp_compaction.py --harness pi --turns 6
    python3 scripts/capture_acp_compaction.py --harness opencode   # re-measure the member

The runbook -- which credential each harness needs, how to install it, and which files
to edit once a capture is in hand -- is
``docs/guides/acp-compaction-capture.md``.

What it does NOT do
-------------------
It does not authenticate anything. No harness here takes a credential from Crew: each
resolves its own provider from its own store, which is why
``agent_sdk/backend_install.py`` probes none and why this script cannot either. A
harness that is not signed in answers the first prompt with its own error, and that
error is reported with the repository's own sign-in remedy for that harness beside it.

It does not write into the committed corpus. The default output is under ``build/``,
which is git-ignored, because a stray ``.jsonl`` inside ``test/fixtures/acp_frames/``
is collected by ``test/test_acp_frame_replay.py`` and would go red for want of a
snapshot the moment it existed. Reviewing a capture by hand and MOVING it in is a
separate, deliberate step.

It does not decide membership. It measures one session and says what it measured.

Exit codes
----------
* ``0`` -- COMPACTED: ``used`` fell below the pre-compact peak. The capture is the
  evidence for a membership.
* ``1`` -- NOT_COMPACTED: the drive worked and ``used`` did not fall. Also evidence,
  and the more interesting kind: it contradicts what the harness's source says.
* ``2`` -- a usage or environment error: bad arguments, an unknown harness, a harness
  that is not installed.
* ``3`` -- the harness refused to work: an auth or provider error rather than a
  measurement.
* ``4`` -- UNPROVEN: the turns ran and no ``usage_update`` frame carried ``used``, so
  this harness does not report the number the bar is written in.
* ``5`` -- the capture was written and is not commit-ready: a recording-host marker
  survived the sweep, or ``--keep-ids`` kept the harness's own ids. The frames are on
  disk either way; nothing is thrown away for failing a sweep.
