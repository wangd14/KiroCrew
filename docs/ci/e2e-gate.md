# The browser E2E gate

```bash
python setup.py test_e2e
```

One command is the whole offline browser gate. It boots a real gateway wired to a
packaged fake model backend, then shells the in-tree Playwright suite at it. No
model, no credentials, no network, no cost.

The main browser job is Linux-only: it uses the CodeBuild fleet where eligible
and otherwise falls back to `ubuntu-latest`. It cannot rely on an unprivileged
user namespace (CodeBuild refuses `unshare(CLONE_NEWUSER)`, and this job does not
alter the hosted runner's namespace policy). Its disposable fake-backend gateway
alone seeds `agent.sandbox_allow_unsandboxed_exec=true`; authenticated browser setup
then sets `agent.sandbox=auto` through the owner API and reapplies the existing
`agent.acp_backend` value so the provider factory refreshes. Both owner-API writes
must succeed before scenarios run, and the model backend remains the packaged fake
executable.

The real private-workflow MCP test runs separately in the
`e2e-private-namespace` job on `ubuntu-latest`. That job enables unprivileged user
namespaces, requires `unshare --mount --map-root-user true` to succeed, and fails
if either the precondition or the test fails.

`setup.py::E2eTestCommand` is the entry point (registered under `cmdclass` as
`test_e2e`). It runs exactly two pytest files:

| File | What it covers |
|---|---|
| `test/test_e2e_smoke.py` | Gateway boot and HTTP-level smoke checks. |
| `test/test_playwright_e2e.py` | The dashboard browser suite, folded in so one command is the whole gate. |

The HTTP smoke turns send the nonempty agent identity returned by slot creation.
They test the configured binding's real ACP round trip without substituting a
template name for its alias. Failed smoke POSTs report the HTTP status and a
bounded machine code, keeping response prose and credentials out of diagnostics.

## What the command sets up

`E2eTestCommand.run()` builds the child pytest invocation itself, so the
environment is not something a caller has to remember:

- `KIROCREW_E2E=1` lifts the `skipif` on both files. Neither runs in a bare
  `pytest` invocation, which is deliberate: the browser leg takes minutes per
  interpreter, far too slow for the per-commit gate.
- `KIROCREW_STRICT_ON_LOOP_PERSIST=1` turns the on-loop session-JSONL persistence
  discipline into an enforced invariant for the duration of the run. The harness
  gateway inherits this env, so any raw on-loop `ConversationLog._locked` entry
  that skipped the `*_off_loop` helpers raises `OnLoopPersistError` and fails the
  gate instead of silently losing transcript data under real contention.
- `-o addopts=` clears the `[tool:pytest]` defaults from `setup.cfg` (`-n auto`,
  `--dist loadgroup`, `--max-worker-restart=2`, `--timeout=120`). xdist would spawn
  one gateway per worker, and coverage of a subprocess gateway measures nothing, so
  the E2E run is **serial** and uninstrumented by construction. This is the one
  place an `addopts` wipe is correct: it runs two files, not a large selection, so
  the loadgroup invariant that a broad override must preserve does not apply. See
  [../system-specs/common/testing-conventions.md](../system-specs/common/testing-conventions.md).
- `--timeout=1800` replaces the 120s unit-test cap. The browser leg runs several
  minutes per interpreter leg, and with `retries: 2` under box contention a
  retry-heavy run can exceed a shorter cap. A generic pytest timeout kills the run
  and hides which specs actually failed, so the cap is set well above the
  expected worst case. Smoke tests finish in seconds and pay nothing for it.
- `-p no:cacheprovider` keeps the run from writing a pytest cache.

## How the browser leg is wired

`test_playwright_e2e.py::test_dashboard_playwright_suite` does five things in
order:

1. Resolves the in-tree `website/` directory (a sibling of `test/`), its
   Playwright CLI at `website/node_modules/.bin/playwright`, and a **concrete**
   Node >= 18 binary. Node resolution deliberately skips mise shims: a shim is
   cwd-sensitive and the website dir often pins an older Node, so the test scans
   real installs and prepends the winning bin dir to `PATH` for the child.
2. Points `KIROCREW_KIRO_BIN` at `kiro_crew.testing.fake_acp_backend`. That is
   the env var `kiro_cli.py` reads to override the agent binary, so the harness
   gateway spawns the fake instead of a real `kiro-cli`. The fake speaks the
   minimal ACP subset the client drives (`initialize`, `session/new`,
   `session/set_mode`, `session/set_model`, `session/prompt`) and switches
   behavior on bracket markers in the prompt (`[[TOOL]]`, `[[PERMISSION]]`,
   `[[GATED]]`, `[[SLOW]]`, `[[SLOW_NOACK]]`, `[[ERROR]]`), which is what makes
   agent-driven specs deterministic offline. Spawned as the KAS relay (the
   `acp --agent-engine v3` argv, which is how crew-member DMs run by default) it
   also reports every managed MCP server the session declared as `connected`
   through `_kiro/mcp/status` / `_kiro/tools/didChange`, so the KAS harness's
   readiness barrier releases the first prompt instead of timing out.
3. Boots a real gateway with `spawn_feature_gateway(fixture="minimal",
   approval="reads")`, on an isolated temporary `KIROCREW_HOME` seeded
   atomically with gateway startup.
4. Exports the harness env into the Playwright child: `PLAYWRIGHT_BASE_URL`
   (the gateway's port), `PLAYWRIGHT_TOKEN`, `PLAYWRIGHT_RUN_AGENT_SPECS=1`,
   `KIROCREW_E2E_EPHEMERAL=1`, `CI=1`, and `PLAYWRIGHT_JSON_OUTPUT_NAME`.
5. Runs `playwright test --reporter=html,json` with `cwd=website`. A CLI
   `--reporter` replaces the config value, so both are named: `html` keeps the CI
   artifact the config asks for, `json` supplies the machine-readable counts the
   darkening floor below reads.

`KIROCREW_KIRO_BIN` is restored (or removed) in a `finally` block, so the test
cannot leak a fake backend into a later test in the same interpreter.

### The gateway must already be running: `webServer` is not configured

`website/playwright.config.ts` sets `webServer: undefined`. Playwright starts no
server of its own, so a bare `npx playwright test` against a machine with no
gateway on `baseURL` fails on every spec. `test_e2e` is the supported way to run
the suite because it owns the gateway lifecycle.

Config facts worth knowing before you touch a spec:

| Setting | Value | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `testDir` | `./playwright` | Specs live at `website/playwright/*.spec.ts`. |
| `baseURL` | `process.env.PLAYWRIGHT_BASE_URL` or `http://localhost:5476` | 5476 is the default dashboard port, so an ad-hoc local run against a normal gateway works. |
| `locale` | `en-US` | Most specs assert English prose. The app resolves language from `navigator.languages` when nothing is stored, and the harness storage state carries no `mc-lang`, so a `zh-*` runner would render the zh-CN catalog and fail those assertions. Pinning makes that an explicit dependency. |
| `workers` | 1 under `CI` | The harness sets `CI=1`, so the browser leg is serial. |
| `retries` | 2 under `CI` | Absorbs gateway-load timeout flakes. |
| `timeout` | 30s per test | Assertion (`expect`/`poll`) timeout stays at Playwright's 5s default so a genuine slowdown surfaces instead of passing inside a wide window. |
| `grepInvert` | excludes `@needs-agent` unless `PLAYWRIGHT_RUN_AGENT_SPECS` | The default run is the credential-less green set. The harness wires the fake backend, so it opts the agent specs back in. `@needs-live-agent` stays excluded either way and currently tags nothing. |
| browser | Playwright's own bundled Chromium | This fork vends no browser binary; CI installs it with `npx playwright install chromium`, restored from an `actions/cache` entry keyed on the exact `@playwright/test` version. `--with-deps` is deliberately NOT used — see [what CI does](#what-ci-does-around-the-command). |

### Auth flow

Playwright runs two projects. The `setup` project (`playwright/auth.setup.ts`)
navigates once to `/?token=<PLAYWRIGHT_TOKEN>`, lets the gateway exchange the
token for a session cookie, sets the `mc-onboarded` localStorage flag so the
first-run theme overlay cannot intercept clicks, and persists the whole storage
state. The `chromium` project declares `dependencies: ['setup']` and loads that
state, so raw tokens never appear in test-level traces or videos.

The state path is `PLAYWRIGHT_STORAGE_STATE` or `playwright/.auth/state.json`,
and both writer and reader honor the same override. That matters for concurrency:
cookies are bound to one gateway's port and token, so two runs against separate
ephemeral gateways sharing the default file would have the last writer win and
the losers see "session expired".

When no token is supplied the setup project still writes an empty storage state,
because `storageState` must resolve to an existing file or every spec fails with
ENOENT.

## `KIROCREW_E2E_REQUIRE=1`: why a graceful skip needs a marker

The environment the browser leg needs (an in-tree `website/`, its installed
Playwright CLI, a Node >= 18) is not present in a python-only checkout. So
`_unresolved()` has two behaviors:

- **Marker unset** (ad-hoc local or dev run): `pytest.skip`. A contributor
  without the frontend toolchain installed still gets a useful smoke run.
- **`KIROCREW_E2E_REQUIRE` set** (the CI gate): `pytest.fail`. A skip counts as
  a pass, so without this the required gate would go green having run **zero**
  browser specs, which is exactly the dead-suite drift the fold exists to catch.

`.github/workflows/ci.yml`'s `e2e` job sets `KIROCREW_E2E_REQUIRE: "1"`. Set it
on any job you expect to actually exercise the browser.

## The darkening floor

An exit code cannot tell "all specs passed" from "the specs were never
collected". `grepInvert` excludes by tag, and an excluded spec is never collected
and never reported as a skip, so a mis-tagged suite reports green while a third
of it does not run. Every dark spec that was later re-enabled had also rotted:
stale selectors for UI that had moved, because nothing exercised them.

So `_assert_suite_not_darkened()` reads Playwright's JSON report and asserts two
numbers, **even when the run failed** (a red run plus a collapsed count points at
darkening rather than at the reported failure):

- `MIN_EXECUTED_SPECS` is a floor on `expected + flaky`. Both mean "ran and
  ultimately passed"; counting only `expected` would trip the floor whenever CI's
  retries absorb a flake. **Raise it when you add specs.** Only lower it with a
  written reason in the commit body, because a drop means specs stopped running.
- `MAX_SKIPPED_SPECS` is 0. A skip is a silent pass, so a spec should seed its
  preconditions in a fixture rather than skip when they are absent.

A missing or unparseable report is a hard `pytest.fail`, not a pass for lack of
evidence. The floor helper has its own unit tests in the same file, deliberately
**ungated** so they run in the default pytest pass: an unverified guard against
silent darkening is no guard.

## What CI does around the command

`ci.yml`'s `e2e` job (`E2E (stub ACP backend, offline)`) installs the backend
with `--group dev`, runs `npm ci` and `npm run build` in `website/`, stages
`website/dist` into `src/kiro_crew/static/dist` so the specs render the real
bundled dashboard rather than a 404, installs Chromium, resolves the i18n base,
then runs `python scripts/ci_e2e_parallel.py`. The separate
`e2e-private-namespace` job owns the real private-workflow MCP test and does not
serialize the browser job. The CI-only helper overlaps the unchanged
`python setup.py test_e2e` command, dedicated Memory UI pytest command and
`npm --prefix website run i18n:render`. All three outcomes are awaited; no
failure cancels or hides another lane. All three helper outcomes remain mandatory,
with the same 25-minute browser-job ceiling. The private namespace coverage is a
separate mandatory CI job instead of a serial prerequisite, so neither it nor the
head+base render gate consumes the browser lane's critical path.

The staged production bundle, Python packages, Node modules and Chromium
install remain read-only inputs. i18n builds its own `website/dist-dev` and a
separate temporary base tree, retaining the complete locale/surface and vs-base
checks. Each lane has its own `TMPDIR` under `runner.temp/e2e-s` (smoke),
`runner.temp/e2e-u` (UI), or `runner.temp/e2e-i` (i18n), with
short names to leave room for Unix socket paths; the harness continues to create a
fresh data home, agent-spec home and random port per gateway. The dedicated UI
process owns its environment changes, per-scenario authentication files, JSON
reports and output directories. It cannot overwrite the shared suite's auth
state or clear `website/test-results`. Each suite retains its existing worker
count, retries, assertions and per-test timeouts. CPU and RAM remain shared;
current-run CI must confirm that the overlap fits the budget under runner load.

Each lane has a small Linux subreaper supervisor because harness gateways start
new process sessions. During normal execution it reaps already-exited adopted
children, so a harness waiting for its stopped descendants to disappear does not
wait on unreaped zombies. Direct-child exit statuses remain owned by `Popen`.
On cancellation or the UI's 12-minute lane timeout, the supervisor terminates,
escalates and reaps its own descendants, including detached children adopted
after their parent exits. The outer supervisor waits for all lane supervisors
and drains any adopted residue. Already-dead children are reaped without failing
a successful lane; children observed still alive during final cleanup fail that
lane even when the drain succeeds. No PID is signalled after it has been reaped.
The helper adds no test retry or readiness override and does not run on other
OS jobs. Short-process regressions verify these lifecycle rules, not the absence
of live residue or temporary-directory warnings in a particular E2E run.

The read-aloud and member-memory evidence upload steps use `always()` to attempt
upload even after a failure or cancellation. They retain only the existing named
artifacts: partial images/manifests are not completed scenarios. A hard job kill
or runner loss can still prevent upload; `always()` cannot guarantee delivery
after the runner is gone. Short-process scheduler regressions establish waiting,
failure propagation and cancellation cleanup, not private-MCP or browser proof.

### The browser install is budgeted, and installs no apt packages

The job's ceiling is `timeout-minutes: 25`, and the browser install is the step
that historically consumed it. It carries three constraints, all in service of
leaving the specs enough of that budget to actually run:

- **`${RUNNER_TEMP}/ms-playwright` is cached**, keyed on the exact `@playwright/test`
  version read out of `website/package-lock.json`. `PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH`
  points both setup and the non-root test steps at that directory. The key has no
  restore-key prefix on purpose: a near-miss would hand the job a Chromium revision that
  `@playwright/test` does not expect.
- **`--with-deps` is not used.** It runs `apt-get update` first, and when the
  runner's default mirror answers `Ign:` apt falls back and stalls — measured at
  23, 15 and 12 minutes. It also buys nothing this gate asserts on: every shared
  library Chromium needs is already on the `ubuntu-latest` image, and the only
  packages it newly installs are 9 CJK/Thai/Cyrillic font packages. There is no
  pixel comparison anywhere under `website/`, `locale` is pinned to `en-US`, and
  the render gate reads `textContent` rather than measuring geometry. A spec that
  asserts glyph **metrics** for a non-Latin script would need those fonts back —
  as its own bounded, non-fatal step, not by restoring `--with-deps`.
- **`timeout-minutes: 6` on the step.** The download is ~7s and a cache hit is a
  no-op, so anything near the cap is a stalled mirror or CDN. Failing there
  reports the real cause while the job still has budget, instead of the job
  timing out having run zero specs.

### A red run uploads the specs' own failure record

`website/playwright/voice-recovery.spec.ts` contributes three untagged tests to
the executed-spec floor. Desktop and touch cases photograph blocked read-aloud
recovery and its open menu, checking labels, the preserved draft and viewport
fit. The closed-menu frames are taken without hovering or focusing the reply,
so they prove that recovery controls remain visible. A separate desktop case
photographs the failed-playback notice, follows its settings link, and checks
and photographs the highlighted Text-to-speech provider field.

These tests reuse the suite's authenticated page/browser fixtures and production
dashboard, with fixture API responses and injected `voice-error` events; they
neither record the microphone nor prove audible speech. After E2E, the
`voice-recovery-evidence` artifact retains six PNGs on a successful run plus
per-attempt provenance: checkout, PR-head, source-file, build, served-document
and frame hashes, viewport and browser version. Playwright owns retries and
timeouts; each attempt writes its own output directory, including partial
evidence if a later assertion fails.

`website/playwright/member-memory.spec.ts` also captures the real dashboard
with synthetic member and memory data in ten focused scenarios. The `member-memory-ui-evidence` artifact
retains its PNGs and focused-spec WebM recordings on successful and failed attempts: desktop/mobile records,
copy selection, record details, proposals, restore confirmation and pending
restore, a working legacy V1 member and creation of a separate empty V2 member, plus V1/V2 bulk
selection and edit/forget previews. These are screenshots
of the test's interaction states, not evidence of a live provider response or a
Crew delegation. The artifact belongs to its GitHub Actions run and checkout;
partial screenshots from a failed attempt are not a completed scenario. The
upload includes only the named media and `member-memory-evidence.json`, never
the browser authentication state. Each attempt's directory contains
`member-memory-walkthrough.webm` and that JSON manifest with test title, status,
retry, exact CI checkout SHA, run ID and run attempt. Recording is enabled only
inside this memory spec, including successful tests; the global video setting
and authentication setup are unchanged. The first walkthrough shows the member
header/avatar, copy selection, correction preview/save, current toolbar, a
separate empty member and forgetting. The recovery walkthrough shows backup,
restore confirmation, pending recovery across reload and cancellation while the
active records stay unchanged. It does not activate a restore by restarting the
gateway. It also imports an episode through the owner API, corrects its explicitly
linked fact, and restores the resulting replaced experience through the real
recovery API. The restored episode keeps its ID, text, source and creation time;
the active facts and observed Global/peer records remain unchanged by restoration.
The legacy walkthrough captures preserved V1 guidance and the absence of a setup
action. A separately created V2 member shows a disabled Manage memory action with
its visible unsaved-work reason. A separate scenario reads
intentional unavailable and mismatched bindings seeded only in the disposable
gateway's configuration, verifies a healthy member can still be created, and
performs a real identity-list Retry without claiming it repairs those bindings.
No healthy peer store is implied by the deliberately mismatched declaration;
the attempt manifest records that fixture limitation. These seven added capture
points are authored and pending CI execution. Only a completed CI run can supply these recordings; source authoring
alone is not rendered evidence.
Its retention is seven days, and it does not fail when setup produced no images.

When the job fails, a final `if: failure()` step uploads
`website/test-results/` and `website/playwright-report/` as the
`e2e-playwright-failures` artifact (7-day retention). `test-results/` holds one
directory per failed attempt: `error-context.md` (the ARIA snapshot of the page
at the failing assertion — the thing that says whether a locator matched the
wrong row or no row), the `on-first-retry` trace, and any screenshot. The html
report next to it is the one `--reporter=html` writes.

The job's log alone is not enough to triage a spec failure: it names
`error-context.md` and prints nothing from it. #8526 (a ghost transcript from the
previous session rendering for a few hundred ms after the first send) was
narrowed for hours from that one line before a local run produced the snapshot.
Download the artifact first; bisect second.

The app-detail scenario also captures the compact Design Critique description
at desktop and 390px widths. The separate `gallery-copy-ui-evidence` artifact
retains those PNGs for seven days. Capture code alone is not rendered evidence;
the current run must reach and pass that scenario before its images are used.

`if-no-files-found: ignore`, deliberately: a run that fails before the specs
start (a stalled browser install) has neither directory, and the upload must not
turn that into a second, misleading failure.

### Memory embedding states: one dedicated gateway per state

`website/playwright/memory-embedding-evidence.spec.ts` photographs five
Memory-tab states that describe the WHOLE gateway (its `config.json`, its
download manager, which stores are open), so the shared gateway above cannot
hold them without changing what the shared suite sees. Every test is tagged
`@memory-evidence`, `playwright.config.ts` excludes that tag unless
`PLAYWRIGHT_RUN_MEMORY_EVIDENCE=1`, and the shared run never sets it: the spec
is dark there by design, and `--list` under the shared run shows zero of its
tests. `test/e2e/test_memory_ui_evidence.py` is what runs it, as one lane of the
`Run E2E and dedicated memory UI evidence in parallel` step of the same `e2e`
job, alongside `setup.py test_e2e`. The real private-workflow MCP coverage runs
independently in `e2e-private-namespace`. A red browser lane does not leave the
evidence un-captured: both lanes finish and either failure fails the job; nothing
is `continue-on-error`.

Each scenario boots its own `spawn_feature_gateway(fixture="minimal")`,
prepares the state through production surfaces only, waits until
`/api/memory/embedding-status` reports it, then runs exactly one spec test with
`--grep` and absolute spec/config paths. Its own absolute output directory is
passed as `PLAYWRIGHT_MEMORY_EVIDENCE_OUTPUT_DIR` and consumed by the Playwright
configuration only when `PLAYWRIGHT_RUN_MEMORY_EVIDENCE=1`, not as a command-line
argument. Playwright runs with `cwd=tmp_path`; its default evidence output is
`tmp_path/evidence/<scenario>`. CI sets `KIROCREW_MEMORY_UI_EVIDENCE_DIR` to
`${{ runner.temp }}/memory-embedding-evidence`, with one scenario subdirectory
per invocation (Playwright clears its output dir per run, so a shared one would erase the
previous scenario). The driver requires one passed test from that file and zero
skips per scenario. No `route.fulfill`, no frontend state edit, no patched
download manager; the fake ACP model backend is the only stand-in.

| Scenario | How the gateway gets there | What the spec asserts and photographs |
|---|---|---|
| `missing-custom-legacy` | `memory.embed_model_path` set to a file that does not exist, plus `embed_model_legacy_ids`, written to the gateway's own `config.json` (the knob is config-file-only by design) | `setup_error_code=model_path_not_found` + `legacy_embedding_vectors`; the legacy warning says "fix the path first" and owns the only settings link, that link focuses the model path field, no duplicate error pointer appears, the Embedding Model field shows `No file at that path.` exactly once with none of the backend prose, the button reads `Rebuild memory vectors` (the field still holds the configured path) and is disabled, no rebuild line |
| `missing-custom-pointer` | The same missing `memory.embed_model_path`, with NO `embed_model_legacy_ids` | `setup_error_code=model_path_not_found` and an empty `setup_warning_code`; no legacy warning, so the Vector Memory card renders the short `embedding-setup-error-pointer` (the fault and its cost: keyword search meanwhile) that carries neither the message nor the path, names "settings" exactly once through its only settings link (`href="#embed-model-path"`, focuses the field) rather than restating the destination in prose, and no diagnostic block; `No file at that path.` appears exactly once, under the field, the full path appears in no text node (it remains in the input value and disclosure tooltip), the custom filename appears exactly once in the existing model disclosure with the API's dimension and not in either error notice, `Rebuild memory vectors` is disabled, no rebuild line |
| `configured-inactive` | A fresh gateway: the bundled file was never downloaded | `model_id`/`model_dim` known, `model_active=false`; header `data-state=inactive` reading `Configured: … · not active`, never `Active model unknown`; badge muted (`text-[var(--muted)]`, never the `text-ok` success colour); no re-embedding progressbar, no rebuild line, no field error, no alert, no raw `setup_error` prose, no keyword-search reassurance; the Vector Memory card's Embeddings stat tile (`embeddings-stat-badge`) reads `data-state=inactive` / `not active` in the same muted colour, never `text-warn`/`text-ok` and never `model loading`; the button offers an ENABLED `Rebuild memory vectors` for the unchanged bundled default. Second image: that stat tile scrolled into the viewport (it sits on the Vector Memory card, above the header framed by the first image) so the muted `not active` tile is photographed, not only asserted. Third image: that button clicked opens the confirm modal under the card's own neutral `Embedding Model` title (never `Change the embedding model?`), with a `Rebuild memory vectors` confirm (no `Change model`) and the configured-model reload and vector-rebuild warning (no "new one" claim); the modal is then CANCELLED, the dialog is gone, and the status read afterwards shows no apply in flight (`reembed.step` not `applying`/`running`, `model_active` still `false`) — nothing is submitted to a gateway whose bundled file is absent. The manifest records `reapplyConfirm.opened/cancelled` and the step read after cancel |
| `deferred-repair` | `memory.embed_rebuild_generation` set, a `memory_stores` entry declared but never opened, two facts written through `PUT /api/memory/semantic` | `reembed.step=deferred`; the single `embed-model-repair-status` line names only the NON-ZERO counts exactly as the API reports them, each with its own plural form, joined by `Intl.ListFormat` for the UI language (the spec recomputes the expected sentence from the API counts), never their sum, never a `0 …` clause, and not `repair_unknown`; the status has no progress bar and no alert; the muted `Keyword search still works. Safe to leave this page.` reassurance renders exactly once under it, and no failure hint |
| `download-failed` | Exported `KIROCREW_EMBED_MODEL_URL=https://127.0.0.1:<closed port>/…` and an empty `OLLAMA_MODELS`; boot with a missing custom path so the boot-time background download (6 attempts, hours of backoff, holds the manager lock) declines; `restart(skip_model_download=False)`; remove the path from `config.json`; the spec POSTs `/api/memory/enable-embeddings` (the dashboard's Retry) | Polls until `download_step == "failed"` (not `waiting_retry`), requires `waiting_retry` to have been observed, `download_attempt=3`, `setup_error_code=model_download_failed`; photographs the terminal notice with `View details` collapsed, then expanded, then collapsed again; the raw `setup_error` prose is inside the expanded details and nowhere else (not in the notice, not on the Embedding Model card), and no field error or rebuild line renders |

The configured-inactive scenario also captures a real checkpoint-storage warning
on `/workflows`. After the workflow service is readable, the driver replaces only
its empty ephemeral `workflows/runs` directory with a file (a non-empty directory
refuses the setup). After the existing three Memory captures, the browser starts
a small workflow through the authenticated owner API. It waits for both a finished
result and the storage warning from the real failing directory operation, then
opens Runs and photographs `WorkflowRunTree` showing the warning beside the retained
result. The manifest records only the run ID, status and assertion booleans.
No HTTP response or frontend state is injected to manufacture that state.

HTTP READY is not memory-data readiness. Before changing the deferred fixture's
config or writing its facts, the driver waits for a successful read of the exact
store's statistics endpoint. Only HTTP 503 is retried, for a bounded thirty seconds;
other failures propagate and a permanently unavailable store still fails the test.
The deferred scenario waits for its exact requested rebuild generation before
launching the browser. It observes the actual browser embedding-status response
shared by both cards and computes its exact expected sentence from that snapshot.
A second independent API read is not an oracle for the currently rendered data:
the inventory may change between requests before the next 30-second refresh.
The full localized sentence (including its
all-memory-stores scope), independent plural forms and zero omission stay exact
assertions; the deferred count is not pinned to the one explicitly added store.

`spawn_feature_gateway(skip_model_download=...)` and
`GatewayHandle.restart(skip_model_download=...)` are the only harness switch this
adds: `True` (default) exports `KIROCREW_SKIP_MODEL_DOWNLOAD=1` as before,
`False` drops it for that one gateway. The production download manager honours
that flag for the dashboard's Retry click as well as the boot task, which is why
the terminal download state cannot be reached under the shared gateway. The
retry policy is the production constant (3 attempts, 60s then 120s), so the
scenario costs about three minutes; the CI helper enforces a 12-minute ceiling
for the dedicated UI lane, without imposing that ceiling on the shared suite.
`harness_environment()` is unit-tested in `test/test_harness.py`: the default
skip, the drop, and that `KIROCREW_HOME`/`KIRO_HOME` stay pinned either way.
The supervisor restart test also verifies that only the download switch changes:
all other environment values retain the initial launch snapshot. The failed
mirror port stays bound without listening until teardown, and loopback hosts
are excluded from proxies for this scenario.

Dedicated outputs land under the runner's temporary
`memory-embedding-evidence/<scenario>/` directory, or `tmp_path/evidence/<scenario>`
without the CI override. The `member-memory-ui-evidence` uploader collects
`memory-v2-embedding-*.png` and `memory-v2-embedding-evidence.json` from that
explicit temporary root. These files do not live under `website/test-results`;
the ordinary shared suite's output paths remain unchanged. The
manifest records the scenario, test status and retry, the checkout and PR-head
SHAs, run id and attempt, the image names, and the non-secret status fields the
assertions read (`model_active`, `download_step`, `setup_error_code`, the three
repair counts). The dedicated invocation disables Playwright retries: a retry must not reuse a
mutated download manager as if it were a fresh scenario. Its child invocation
has a 540-second bound inside the 600-second pytest bound; neither changes the
shared browser suite's retry or timeout policy.

The manifest never records the token, cookies, the home path or raw backend
prose (the spec reads `setup_error` only to assert it is absent from the page).
`model_identity_unverified`, `model_verification_failed`, `repair_unknown` and
the unknown-model header (`Active model unknown`, no provenance badge) are not
exercised by these five scenarios: no stable real-gateway fixture for them has
been verified here, their behaviour is covered by unit tests only, and no image
claims those states. The same holds for the Embedding Model card's return-focus
re-check of a restored file (`EmbeddingModelCard.apply.test.tsx`): it needs a
file restored between two reads and a window focus event, which no scenario
stages. This records what is verified, not that such a fixture is
impossible. Each `SCENARIOS` fragment is a `--grep` regex over the
full spec title; `test/test_memory_ui_evidence_driver.py` pins offline that every
fragment selects exactly one title and every title has a scenario, so a new
scenario cannot silently run its neighbour. Collection and unit checks are not
proof of browser execution:
the CI scenarios must actually pass before their images count as evidence.

## The distribution layer: install the artifact, then boot it

The browser gate above and the backend shards both run against a SOURCE tree. A
whole class of failure is invisible to both, because it lives in packaging
metadata that a package manager or an installer interprets rather than in code we
run: a dependency name that does not exist in the target distro, a registry
registration that never lands, a prune that drops a module the packaged
interpreter imports at boot. Each of those produces an artifact that builds green
and then refuses to install or refuses to start.

Two legs cover it, and neither costs a PR any minutes: both live in
`workflow_call` workflows reached from `nightly.yml` and `release.yml`.

| Leg | Job | Script | What only a real install shows |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Linux | `build-desktop.yml` -> `Smoke-install Linux packages (deb + rpm)` | `scripts/smoke-linux-packages.sh` | dependency names resolve in Ubuntu 24.04 and Amazon Linux 2023, the `.desktop` entry's `StartupWMClass` equals Electron's app_id, the maintainer scripts place and remove `/usr/bin/<exe>`, and the beacon stamp names THIS format |
| Windows | `build-windows.yml` -> `Smoke-install Windows installer (x64)` | `scripts/smoke-windows-install.ps1` | the uninstall registration and the `InstallLocation` in its paired install-info key (`<hive>\Software\<GUID>`, where electron-builder writes it), the install-root ownership boundary, where the Start Menu shortcut POINTS, that the bundled CLI runs, that the installed gateway answers `/api/health`, and that a silent uninstall removes the registration, the install-info key and the tree |

The Windows leg is gated on the build job's `artifact_uploaded` output rather
than on `needs` alone: publish runs build Windows under `continue-on-error`
(`soft_fail`), and a job that failed under it still reads as success to its
dependents, so without the gate a packaging or signing failure would run the
smoke install against an artifact that was never uploaded and redden the very
release run `soft_fail` keeps green. The output is set by the step after the
upload, so it exists only when there is an artifact to consume.

Both scripts DERIVE every identity from the artifact rather than naming it. The
nightly channel deliberately ships different ones so it can sit beside stable:
`packaging/build-desktop.sh` overrides `productName`, `extraMetadata.name`,
`deb.packageName`, `linux.executableName` and `nsis.guid` for a `-nightly.`
version, which moves the install directory, the launcher name, the registry key
and the shortcut name together. Hardcoding stable's spelling fails the gate on
every nightly build, and because a failed job inside a reusable workflow fails
the CALLER's job, that would silently skip a whole platform's publication. The
Linux script reads the package's own declared name and its desktop entry's
filename; the Windows script diffs the uninstall registry around the install and
reads the registration that appeared.

Reading the repository's `website/electron/package.json` would be just as wrong
on Windows as hardcoding: those channel overrides are electron-builder CLI flags,
so the file on disk still says `KiroCrew` while the artifact says otherwise.

### What the Windows smoke does NOT assert

There is no `PATH` edit to assert. The `nsis` block in
`website/electron/package.json` declares no PATH handling and
`website/electron/build/installer.nsh` touches only shortcuts and the
electron-updater cache, so a desktop install puts no `kirocrew` on `PATH`. The
bundled CLI is exercised at its packaged path
(`resources\backend-dist\kirocrew-backend\bin\kirocrew.cmd`) as its own new
process instead, which is the path
[windows-install.md](../guides/windows-install.md) describes and the one the
managed-server invocation resolves.

### `build.yml`'s installer job boots the gateway it installed, on every PR

`build.yml`'s `build-windows-installer` job compiles an NSIS installer on every
qualifying PR, installs it silently, and runs
`.github/scripts/test-windows-installer.ps1` with NO `-SkipGatewayValidation`.
The script starts the just-installed bundled interpreter against an isolated data
home and requires `/api/ready` within 50 seconds, so an artifact that installs
but cannot boot fails at review time.

Its backend payload is a real python-build-standalone runtime carrying the wheel
`build-wheel` produced (the job `needs` it, so the bundled bytes are the ones
users install). The job repeats the same assembly
`packaging/build-desktop.sh`'s `build_backend_windows` performs -- PBS runtime,
`pip install`, the relocatable `bin/kirocrew.cmd` shim, a self-containment check
under `PYTHONNOUSERSITE=1`, then `packaging/precompile_windows.py` for the
measured gateway import closure -- minus the voice extras, which add a
pywhispercpp and numpy download for a code path a gateway boot never reaches.

`KIROCREW_KIRO_BIN` points at a `.cmd` shim running
`kiro_crew.testing.fake_acp_backend` out of the INSTALLED payload through the
INSTALLED interpreter, so readiness needs no model, no network and no sign-in.
`KIROCREW_SKIP_MODEL_DOWNLOAD=1` keeps the embedding model out of a 50-second
ceiling.

Two ceilings became load-bearing with that change and were not before. The
install-duration ceiling (120 s) previously measured the extraction of a 40-byte
batch file, so it proved nothing about a real install; it now measures one.
`MinStartupPycs` is passed as 750 rather than the script's 1000 default, because
the default describes the full release bundle and this job omits the voice
extras: the core closure of `kiro_crew.cli_server` measures about 990 sources, so
750 leaves headroom for the win32 closure differing while still catching what the
assertion exists for, which is bytecode filtered out of the artifact or a
launcher redirecting imports into an empty user cache. Both land near zero.

Before this the job staged a two-line `@echo off` batch file as its entire
backend payload and therefore had to pass `-SkipGatewayValidation`, since there
was no interpreter for the gateway leg to launch. The whole class of defect that
leaves an installable-but-unbootable artifact had no PR gate at all.

`build-windows.yml`'s nightly smoke job remains the broader one: it exercises the
SIGNED installer, the Start Menu shortcut's target, the bundled CLI and a silent
uninstall, none of which the PR lane covers.

Related: [i18n-gates.md](i18n-gates.md) for the render-time gate that shares this
job, and [ci-and-reviews.md](ci-and-reviews.md) for where `e2e` sits among the
other PR gates.

The private member memory specs use the real gateway and database. They cover
explicit V1-to-member copying with provenance, correction/reload/forgetting,
cross-member isolation, persisted/cancellable backup staging, and the empty
member's exact conversation binding across reload. Desktop and
390px captures accompany the first flow. Their write guard requires
`KIROCREW_E2E_EPHEMERAL=1`, which the isolated gateway harness sets; it must never
be set for an operator gateway. The strict reporter enforces the executed-test
floor and refuses skips or flaky retries. The same `e2e` job must also pass its
parallel i18n render lane before the job is green; the render lane does not
precede these browser scenarios.

## The cross-OS gateway boot matrix

The browser and private-namespace lanes above are Linux-only.
`test/e2e/test_gateway_boot_matrix.py` is the one asset that boots a real gateway
on **macOS and Windows too**, and `ci.yml`'s
`e2e-boot-matrix` job is what runs it: `fail-fast: false`,
`needs: [changes, await-fast-gate]`, 20 minutes, and `strategy.matrix.os` of `ubuntu-latest`
and `windows-latest` on a pull request, plus `macos-15` on the push-to-main path.
The mac leg is event-conditional for the queue, not the runtime: it waited ~200
minutes for a `macos-15` runner on every pull request and was the only leg that did,
while on main the wait costs nobody a merge. The real-Darwin boot stays covered
twice — that leg, and `nightly.yml`'s `pod-scenarios`, which boots a real
service-managed pod on `macos-15`.

### Why it exists

Before it, no job on either of those runners started a gateway at all: the whole
E2E surface is gated on `KIROCREW_E2E`, which only `setup.py test_e2e` sets, and
only the Linux `e2e` job runs that. That is one of the two holes
[#8117](https://github.com/kirodotdev/KiroCrew/pull/8117) fell through, reverted
in
[56f67aa43](https://github.com/kirodotdev/KiroCrew/commit/56f67aa43f00f9484c346a8d1669b39102a63c78).
It added a settings-file probe to `sandbox.wrap_argv`'s Windows delegation
branch, so on a fresh Windows host -- where that file does not exist -- the Kiro
ACP spawn stopped delegating to Kiro CLI's own sandbox, fell through to the
no-backend fail-closed path, and the gateway never became usable. The unit test
that pinned that branch, `test/test_sandbox_argv.py`, is in
`test/windows-collect-ignore.txt`, and the PR changed its mock to hardcode the
one answer a fresh Windows host cannot give. No second unit test closes that;
only a real boot on the real platform does.

### What it asserts

Seven tests, each on its own gateway and its own scratch `KIROCREW_HOME`.
`KIROCREW_KIRO_BIN` comes from `harness.fake_acp_backend_launcher`: the fake
backend's own `.py` on POSIX (exec'd through its shebang), and a generated
`kiro-backend.cmd` shim on Windows, because `CreateProcess` refuses a `.py` path.
The first Windows run of this module is why that helper exists: the gateway
booted, answered `/api/health`, resolved the `acp` provider, and then never
completed a turn, because the spawn of the `.py` path failed silently. A failed
first request or a missing reply reports `GatewayHandle.diagnostics()` (exit
status, stderr tail, stdout tail after READY) in the assertion, since on macOS
and Windows that tail is the only evidence a maintainer without that OS gets.

| Test | What it pins |
|---|---|
| `test_gateway_boots_and_answers_health` | `KIROCREW_READY:` then an unauthenticated `GET /api/health` 200. |
| `test_resolved_provider_is_acp` | The provider resolves to `acp`, so the `KIROCREW_KIRO_BIN` seam fires. |
| `test_prompt_returns_the_fake_backend_reply` | One session create plus one prompt returns the fake backend's reply. `/api/health` can answer while the ACP spawn is refused, so this is the load-bearing one. |
| `test_tool_marker_prompt_completes_the_turn` | A `[[TOOL]]` prompt still completes its turn. |
| `test_seeded_sandbox_mode_boots_and_runs_a_turn[minimal]` | `agent.sandbox: "off"` boots and serves. |
| `test_seeded_sandbox_mode_boots_and_runs_a_turn[rich]` | The shipped `auto` default boots and serves. **This is the #8117 pin.** |
| `test_shutdown_leaves_no_gateway_child_alive` | Teardown reaps the tree: the pid is gone (via `platform_compat.pid_exists`, never `os.kill(pid, 0)`) and the port refuses connections. |

The tier is expressed as a SEED FIXTURE rather than a post-boot config write,
because `agent.sandbox` is read at boot: `minimal` states `"off"` and `rich`
omits the key, so it resolves to the shipped default, which is the tier a fresh
install runs. The test asserts the fixture still says so, so editing either
fixture fails there instead of quietly collapsing the matrix to one tier tested
twice.

### `READY` is not "recovery finished"

The gateway binds its socket and prints `KIROCREW_READY:` **before** memory
startup recovery ends, so HTTP answers during that window instead of hanging.
A write issued inside it is refused: `memory_startup.require_memory_prepared()`
raises, and callers see the one refusal through two shapes — 503 on a read, 409
`member_memory_unavailable` on a write.

`_booted` therefore hands out its client only after `_await_memory_recovery`
polls a memory read until the gateway admits it, so a test may write on its
first line. Every module sharing `_booted` gets that for free
(`test_private_workflow_memory.py`, `test_real_kiro_smoke.py`); a test that boots
`spawn_feature_gateway` directly still owns the wait itself, which is what
`test_memory_ui_evidence.py`'s local `_await_ready` does. A store that never
becomes ready fails in the wait, carrying the gateway's own body and
diagnostics, rather than at whichever line happened to write first.

**A restart re-enters the window.** `handle.restart()` boots a second gateway on
the same `KIROCREW_HOME`, so a client built from the new handle is back before
recovery — and it does not come from `_booted`, so nothing waits for it.
`test_private_workflow_memory.py` calls `_await_memory_recovery` itself there.

The refusal a caller sees names the route, not the cause, so all three shapes
mean the same thing:

| Read | Refusal during recovery | Where it comes from |
|---|---|---|
| a memory read | 503 | `require_memory_ready` |
| a member write (`POST /api/agents`) | 409 `member_memory_unavailable` | `require_memory_prepared` |
| a workflow run read | 403 `workflow_memory_unavailable` | `authorize_run` → `WorkflowScope.validate` → `require_memory_store` |

Only the first is worth polling: `require_memory_ready` calls
`require_memory_prepared` itself, so a memory read the gateway admits proves the
other two are open. A per-store recovery *error* is terminal rather than "not
yet", so waiting cannot mask one.

Under `auto`, the turn expectation off Windows is DERIVED from the product's own
backend probe rather than assumed. A host with a real backend (macOS seatbelt,
Linux user namespaces) must complete the turn; a host that genuinely has none
must FAIL CLOSED with a named sandbox refusal and stay healthy. `ubuntu-latest`
is that second host: its unprivileged user namespaces are AppArmor-restricted,
which is why `backend-test-sandbox` has to clear a sysctl to get one. On Windows
the expectation is unconditionally the first, so a #8117-style regression cannot
hide in the fail-closed branch.

### `KIROCREW_E2E_MATRIX_REQUIRE=1`: the second marker

Same mechanism as `KIROCREW_E2E_REQUIRE` above, for a different module. An unmet
PRECONDITION (the packaged fake ACP backend missing, `kiro_crew.testing` not
importable) is a graceful `pytest.skip` on a local run and a `pytest.fail` on the
job. Set it wherever you expect gateways to actually boot.

## Real-`kiro-cli` opt-in smoke

`test/e2e/test_real_kiro_smoke.py` is the one test in this gate that uses the
host's signed-in CLI and real model service. It can incur network traffic, model
latency, and account usage, so it is never part of the default offline gate.

- `KIROCREW_E2E_REAL_KIRO=1` activates it.
- `KIROCREW_E2E_REAL_KIRO_REQUIRE=1` both activates it and turns a missing CLI,
  sign-in, or safe-host precondition into a failure. A required run cannot pass
  as a module-level skip.
- Resolution ignores an inherited `KIROCREW_KIRO_BIN` test override. Immediately
  before boot, the exact pinned binary runs `kiro-cli whoami` with the gateway's
  final child environment and cwd. `KIRO_HOME` remains the harness-owned
  `<KIROCREW_HOME>/kiro`; authentication uses the existing independent OS/account
  store without changing HOME, USERPROFILE, or account-store locations. Failed
  authentication never falls back to real-home session storage.
- Every token-bearing dashboard request uses `build_loopback_opener`, which
  disables environment proxies and rejects redirects.
- The gateway uses `--approval interactive`. The live test accepts hook
  auto-approval of the confined nonce read; the exact allow-once polling verifier
  and rejection of a different path remain independently covered offline.
- A private project agent is derived with the existing grant-stripping helper,
  from a minimal test spec rather than a host spec. It mounts only the test's
  `@real-smoke/read` MCP tool: no native filesystem, shell, network, global MCP,
  lifecycle hooks, resources, or native automatic grants. No host agent file is
  created or changed.
- A test-only policy confines `filesystem.read` to the exact nonce path and MCP
  access to that one tool. The gateway must report the read ceiling installed.
  The small stdio tool reuses `run_mcp_stdio_loop` and the production
  `HookManager` at its own execution boundary, before opening a file. Thus even
  a native MCP pre-approval cannot skip the path check. This is deliberate:
  native built-in reads on the tested CLI did not honor the grant-free spec's
  expected permission routing, so they are not exposed by this smoke.
- The same session then attempts a second synthetic file. Success requires an
  actual governance-denial tool event, no occurrence of its secret marker, and
  a read-effect receipt containing only the permitted nonce file. A model merely
  saying it refused is not denial evidence. This proves the bounded test tool,
  not unrestricted native-tool or host-filesystem confinement.
- Success requires the slot to stop running without an error or queued recovery,
  the correlated tool event to finish with output exactly equal to the nonce,
  and one assistant message whose body is exactly that nonce. A streaming chunk
  or a nonce appearing only in JSON metadata is not completion evidence.

Before a preflight runs, the harness seeds its empty owned directory using the
existing `seed()` API in a child with the final environment. The preflight may
then populate private CLI settings or audit state without violating seed's
nonempty guard. This prepared case omits gateway `--seed`; ordinary callers
without a preflight retain startup seeding. No replacement or preflight-data
wipe is used.

The native CLI documents `KIRO_HOME` as relocating agents, settings, and sessions
([native configuration scopes](https://kiro.dev/docs/configuration/#scopes)). This
is the native writer control, not the Python-only session-reader overrides. A
fresh Python preflight verifies that both the config resolver and agent target
point at the harness-private tree. It also requires the existing launcher to be
usable on the final child PATH before gateway boot. No shared agent specs,
settings, credential files, or real-home transcript directories are inspected,
copied, linked, or modified by this preflight.

After each successful turn the smoke requires nonempty, regular native transcript
files under the owned `KIRO_HOME/sessions/cli` directory. This observes actual
native files without reading their contents or depending on a deferred session
map. The harness owns the entire directory from before native process startup:
a transcript written before session creation responds or initialization fails is
still private and included in cleanup, even if its ID was never published.

The harness removes its owned tree only after its whole-process-tree termination
verdict. The smoke requires `GatewayHandle.teardown_confirmed` and checks that
the private home is actually absent after teardown; a swallowed filesystem
cleanup error cannot count as success. An unconfirmed stop preserves the tree
and fails the smoke. There is no shared-home transcript deletion, directory
comparison, prompt matching, exact-ID purge, or real-home escape hatch.

When an exact `kiro_bin` is supplied, the harness prepends the existing gateway
launcher's directory to the child PATH without modifying the parent environment
or installing a launcher. Missing/unreachable launchers fail before `Popen`.
The fresh smoke preflight additionally checks the production resolver and PATH
name the same usable launcher, making first-run installation unnecessary.

The harness sets the checkout root (`src.parent`) as gateway cwd for **all**
callers, not only the real-CLI smoke. This keeps cwd-dependent source/install
resolution identical between the exact-environment preflight and gateway boot,
and prevents the caller's working directory from silently choosing a different
resolution context. Callers must not rely on the gateway inheriting their cwd;
this does not relocate the harness's throwaway data home.

### Who runs the real-CLI smoke, and when

No workflow runs it. It spends the operator's own signed-in account, so it is
never scheduled, never triggered by a label, and never wired into `ci.yml` or
`nightly.yml`: running it is an explicit act by a person who has agreed to that
account usage. Two named owners, two named moments:

| Owner | When | Mode |
|---|---|---|
| The PR author | before requesting review on a change to the ACP client or kiro-cli transport (`src/kiro_crew/acp/`, `src/kiro_crew/kiro_cli.py`), the harness (`src/kiro_crew/testing/harness.py`), the private-agent derivation the smoke uses, or the tool-governance gate (`hooks.py`, the PreToolUse path) | required |
| The release verifier | before adopting a new installed `kiro-cli` version as the one releases are cut against | required |

Required mode is the exact invocation below; the `_REQUIRE` marker turns a
missing CLI, a failed `kiro-cli whoami`, or an unsafe host into a FAILURE, so a
run that could not reach the real CLI cannot be filed as a pass:

```bash
KIROCREW_E2E_REAL_KIRO_REQUIRE=1 python -m pytest -v -p no:cacheprovider \
  -o addopts= -n0 --timeout=600 test/e2e/test_real_kiro_smoke.py
```

`KIROCREW_E2E_REAL_KIRO=1` alone is the best-effort form for a developer who
wants a skip rather than a failure when the host is not signed in. Both are
opt-in flags read by the module's own `skipif`; nothing sets them for you.

What to record with the change (in the PR description, or the release notes'
verification section): the checkout SHA the run was made at, the `kiro-cli
--version` output, pass or fail, and the pytest summary line. Nothing else. The
transcript, the model's reply, the nonce, tokens and any path under the real
`~/.kiro` are not evidence and must not be pasted anywhere. A run that has not
happened is not recorded; this document names the cadence and the command, not
any run made under it.

### The job's own honesty checks

- **`KIROCREW_HARNESS_READY_TIMEOUT` per OS**: 60 on Ubuntu, 90 on macOS, 180 on
  Windows. It lives in the job env, not the test, so a slow runner is retunable
  without a code change. Windows needs the widest window: subprocess spawn and
  filesystem latency there are measurably slower, the conditions
  [#9172](https://github.com/kirodotdev/KiroCrew/pull/9172) addressed when a slow
  disk killed the gateway.
- **`-n0` with `--timeout=420`**: the module spawns a real process per test, and
  under xdist a block takes the worker with it, which on Windows aborts the run.
  The cap sits above the widest readiness window plus the per-turn reply ceiling,
  so a stuck turn fails by name.
- **A canary grep for `7 passed`**, copied from the macOS peer-identity canary.
  `pytest` exits 0 on a fully skipped module, so the exit code cannot tell seven
  booted gateways from a module that was never collected. Raise the number when
  you add a test to that file.
- **`shell: bash` on every leg**, so one command text serves all three; the
  Windows default is pwsh, where `tee` and `grep` are not these tools.

`pr-readiness.yml` needs no entry: it resolves lanes by WORKFLOW FILE
(`ci.yml` -> `CI`), never by job name, so every job inside `ci.yml` is already
part of the required `CI` verdict.

## WebKit opt-in lane: `webkit-mobile`

`website/playwright/*.webkit.spec.ts` run on Playwright's WebKit engine with
iPhone emulation, for behaviour that only mobile Safari exhibits (today: the
transcript's hide/return re-placement in
`chat-visibility-replace.webkit.spec.ts`). The engine is not installed by the
gate above (`npx playwright install chromium`), so the specs live under an
opt-in project: `PLAYWRIGHT_RUN_WEBKIT=1` adds the `webkit-mobile` project
(`devices['iPhone 13']`, `testMatch: /\.webkit\.spec\.ts$/`) and the
`chromium` project `testIgnore`s the same files, so a default run never
collects them and cannot skip-pass them under the darkening floor. Specs that
drive turns carry `@needs-agent` like every other turn-driving spec, so they
only run against the fake-ACP harness.

WebKit needs a set of shared libraries the gate's runner image does not
carry and this repository's Linux dev hosts often lack, so the supported way
to run the lane is Microsoft's Playwright image against a harness gateway on
the host:

```bash
# host: boot a --test-mode harness gateway serving this checkout (see
# test/test_playwright_e2e.py for the spawn_feature_gateway rig), note PORT/TOKEN
cd website
docker run --rm --network host -u "$(id -u):$(id -g)" -e HOME=/tmp \
  -v "$PWD":/work -w /work \
  -e PLAYWRIGHT_BASE_URL="http://localhost:$PORT" -e PLAYWRIGHT_TOKEN="$TOKEN" \
  -e PLAYWRIGHT_RUN_WEBKIT=1 -e PLAYWRIGHT_RUN_AGENT_SPECS=1 -e KIROCREW_E2E_EPHEMERAL=1 \
  mcr.microsoft.com/playwright:v1.58.2-noble \
  npx playwright test playwright/chat-visibility-replace.webkit.spec.ts \
    --project=webkit-mobile --reporter=list --workers=1
```

### Who runs the WebKit lane, and when

No workflow runs it: a fork pull request cannot add a browser install to the
gate, and the engine download is not budgeted there. Until a maintainer-owned
job picks it up, the lane is run by hand at two named moments:

| Owner | When | Mode |
|---|---|---|
| The PR author | before requesting review on a change to the transcript follow/pin path (anything under `website/src/hooks/virtualizer/`: the `useVirtualChat.ts` facade and the owners it composes, `FollowController.ts` among them) or to any `*.webkit.spec.ts` | required |
| The release verifier | before a release that bumps `@playwright/test`, since the image tag above must match the installed version | required |

A pass is recorded in the PR body's Manual verification section with the
observed values the spec prints (`[webkit-visibility]` lines and the attached
`webkit-observations.json`), so the evidence is quotable rather than a bare
"passed".

## The pod scenario suite (nightly on every OS; per-PR Windows is boot-only unless labelled)

A second E2E lane, orthogonal to the browser gate above. `test/e2e/scenarios/`
boots ONE real service-managed pod through the shipped `kirocrew pod` verbs and
drives six scenario tests across five user-visible flows: a setting saved across
a gateway restart, a cron firing, one agent turn with a tool call, the host service
definition rendering inside a pod's environment, and the built wheel installing
into a clean venv. The recipes are in
[../guides/worktree-verification-recipes.md](../guides/worktree-verification-recipes.md).

Plain pytest, not pytest-bdd or Robot Framework. This repo's isolation, timeout
and sharding story is already pytest-shaped, and a second framework would need a
second isolation story rather than inheriting this one.

Scenario teardown removes the plane only after `pod down` succeeds, `pod ls`
returns a valid empty JSON list, and the pod home is absent. A failed or timed-out
stop preserves the service/task definition, sidecars and home for recovery through
the pod's own stop path; it fails the test rather than attempting force-cleanup.
This applies on Linux, macOS and Windows, including a failed boot before a client
was returned. No PID record, an unresolved handoff, or an empty scratch-path argv
search proves that the service-managed gateway is gone: its checkout executable
can receive the plane only through its environment. The fixture also does not
sweep older planes merely because their owning pytest process died, and refuses
to adopt an existing root after PID reuse. Normal confirmed teardown and pre-boot
CLI-probe cleanup still remove their scratch roots.
Preservation here is by the fixture, not a guarantee against external temp-directory
retention policies; recover a failed plane before another tool reclaims its parent.

### Gating

Same shape as `KIROCREW_E2E_REQUIRE` above, and for the same reason.

- `KIROCREW_E2E_SCENARIOS` unset: every scenario skips. The suite boots a real
  pod, which is minutes and a service manager away from a bare `pytest`.
- `KIROCREW_E2E_REQUIRE=1`: every precondition skip becomes a FAILURE. A skip
  counts as a pass, so without this the job would report green having run zero
  scenarios. It is the same marker the browser gate reads, so one job env serves
  both suites; `test/e2e/scenarios/conftest.py::_required` is the reader.

`KIROCREW_E2E_SCENARIOS_REAL_AGENT=1` is a pod backend-selection knob, and a
narrower one than its name suggests. `conftest.py::_resolve_backend` checks that
a `kiro-cli` is on `PATH` (REFUSING the run otherwise, rather than quietly
serving the fake) and returns no fake path, so `_plane_env` does not ADD its
`KIROCREW_POD_KIRO_BIN` override to the copied `os.environ`; an inherited value
of that variable is not removed, and the pod's normal backend resolution decides
what `KIROCREW_KIRO_BIN` its service definition carries. It pins no identity,
verifies no sign-in, and proves nothing positive or negative about what the
pod's agent may read. Enabling it does NOT turn the 55-test suite into a
supported real-model success gate: `test_subagent_spawn.py` unconditionally
asserts the fake backend's `REPLY_TEXT` and `hello-from-fake` tool event, which
real-model output is not guaranteed to satisfy, and `test_cron_fire.py` asserts
only that a triggered run was recorded with an outcome, not that a real model
answered. No successful live run under this flag is on record. It is retained
for compatibility as an explicit opt-in that nothing sets for you; the presence
check itself is free, but a turn that actually reaches a real model may incur
the operator's own account usage. For a bounded real-`kiro-cli` proof use the
dedicated [`KIROCREW_E2E_REAL_KIRO_REQUIRE=1` smoke](#real-kiro-cli-opt-in-smoke)
instead: a direct throwaway gateway with a confined nonce read, a governance
denial and host-spec/session cleanup evidence. That smoke is not service-manager
pod or cron lifecycle coverage, and this suite is not a real-model gate; neither
replaces the other.

### The `pod-scenarios` job

Lives in `.github/workflows/nightly.yml`, matrix `[ubuntu-latest, macos-15,
windows-latest]` with `fail-fast: false` and `timeout-minutes: 40`. It is not a
`needs:` of any publish lane, so a scenario failure never holds up a nightly
release and a release failure never hides a scenario result. `workflow_dispatch`
on the workflow makes it runnable on a branch -- but the workflow also PUBLISHES,
so a branch dispatch is not how a Windows change gets validated. The suite is not
a default PR gate on any OS; a Windows PR opts into it with the `ci:pod-scenarios`
label; completed hosted Windows runs are recorded
under
[What has actually run on hosted Windows](#what-has-actually-run-on-hosted-windows)
below.

Steps, in order: build the checkout's `.venv` (a pod boots the CHECKOUT's own
`kirocrew`, and the suite refuses to fall back to a global one), `npm ci` plus
`npm run build` in `website/` staged into `src/kiro_crew/static/dist` (a pod
refuses to come up without a bundle), bring up a service manager, run the suite,
upload the pod logs on failure.

**The Linux leg has to CREATE its `systemd --user` session.** A hosted ubuntu
runner has no login session, so there is no per-user manager and no session bus,
and every pod verb refuses through `pod/runtime.py`'s `require_systemd`. The job
runs `sudo loginctl enable-linger "$USER"`, which is the exact remedy that
refusal prints. It then exports `XDG_RUNTIME_DIR=/run/user/<uid>` and
`DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS=unix:path=/run/user/<uid>/bus` into `$GITHUB_ENV`,
because `systemctl --user` locates the manager through those two and a non-login
shell inherits neither. Linger creates the runtime directory asynchronously, so
the step polls for the bus socket rather than sleeping a fixed amount.

That step then PROVES the session in the log with `systemctl --user --version`,
`is-system-running`, and a `show-environment` that fails the job when the manager
cannot be reached. Without the proof a broken session degrades into six skipped
scenarios, and the REQUIRE marker would be the only thing between that and a
green nightly. A systemd-capable container (the pattern `docker-smoke.yml` uses)
is the fallback if a future runner image cannot linger; it is not needed today.

**The Linux leg also has to UNLOCK the namespace sandbox.** `ubuntu-24.04`
restricts unprivileged user namespaces through AppArmor
(`kernel.apparmor_restrict_unprivileged_userns=1`), so the pod gateway's
`unshare(CLONE_NEWNS)` answers `EPERM` and its only Linux sandbox backend is
unavailable. A pod pins `agent.sandbox=auto` with the unsandboxed opt-in off
(`pod/runtime.py`), so the pod's boot probe then refuses the boot -- correctly,
since a gateway whose every agent turn fails while `/health` answers 200 is the
exact condition it exists to catch. The job runs
`sudo sysctl -w kernel.apparmor_restrict_unprivileged_userns=0`, the same step
`ci.yml`'s `e2e` and `backend-test-sandbox` jobs run, and then PROVES it with
`unshare --mount --map-root-user true` so a runner image that stops allowing it
fails by name rather than six scenarios deep. Seeding
`sandbox_allow_unsandboxed_exec` into the pod instead is deliberately not the
remedy: it would pass the suite by running the product in a mode a real pod
refuses.

macOS needs neither. The pod's launchd backend uses the per-user launchd domain,
which a runner session already has, and its seatbelt sandbox backend needs no host
opt-in, so that leg only prints `launchctl print user/<uid>` to keep the two logs
readable side by side.

Windows needs none either: Task Scheduler is a system service every runner
session can reach, and the pod's `require_backend()` probes it by creating a task.

### The canary

Copied from `ci.yml`'s macOS peer-identity step: run by path with `-v -n0`, tee
to `pod-scenarios.log`, then `grep -qE '(^|[^0-9])55 passed'` and fail the step
otherwise. 55 is six user-flow scenarios plus the 49 fixture-isolation checks in
`test/e2e/scenarios/test_conftest.py`, which run in the same invocation. An exit
code cannot tell "every scenario passed" from "every scenario was never
collected", and a precondition-gated suite degrades into exactly that. **Raise
the expected count when you add a scenario** -- in `nightly.yml` AND in the
label-gated step of `ci.yml`'s `pod-boot-windows` job, which pins the same
number; `test/test_pod_scenario_matrix.py` holds the value both must match.

On failure the job uploads `pod-scenarios.log` plus the pod plane's artifact and
log files as `pod-scenarios-logs-<os>` (7 days, `if-no-files-found: ignore`). A
pod's boot refusal is only fully legible in its own journal or log files; the job
log carries just the tail `pod up` chose to print.

### Windows is a matrix add, not a rewrite

No scenario body contains a platform test. Only the pod fixture asks whether this
host can run pods, and it asks the pod's own `runtime.require_backend()`, which
dispatches systemd on Linux, launchd on macOS and Task Scheduler on Windows. So
`windows-latest` is one more entry in `strategy.matrix.os` and nothing else in
the job: `test/test_pod_scenario_matrix.py` asserts that every platform with a
backend is either in the matrix or named in its `PENDING_VALIDATION` table with a
reason, and that table is now empty. Windows has no AF_UNIX, so the pod's private
dashboard socket does not exist there; `pod api` reaches the pod over its
loopback TCP port with a minted token instead (`PodClient.api` in the conftest),
which is why no socket-path budget applies to the Windows plane root.

### What has actually run on hosted Windows

Two different things run on `windows-latest`, and they must not be conflated:

| Lane | Workflow / job | What runs | Cadence |
|---|---|---|---|
| Boot canary | `ci.yml` -> `pod-boot-windows` (`Pod Boot Canary (Windows)`) | `test/test_pod_windows_boot.py`, 3 tests, anchored `3 passed` grep | every PR and every push to `main` |
| Full suite, opt-in | the same `pod-boot-windows` job, extra steps gated on `env.POD_SCENARIOS == 'true'` | the boot canary above PLUS `test/e2e/scenarios/`, 55 tests, anchored `55 passed` grep, against a real Vite-built SPA | only a `pull_request` carrying the `ci:pod-scenarios` label |
| Full suite | `nightly.yml` -> `pod-scenarios` (`windows-latest` leg) | `test/e2e/scenarios/`, 55 tests, anchored `55 passed` grep | nightly |

The default job is boot-only on purpose. It boots the pod against a ONE-FILE SPA
stand-in (`pod up` refuses a checkout with no bundle, and Task Scheduler
supervision is what the canary tests, not the Vite build), installs the control
plane with `--group dev` only, builds the runtime-only payload `.venv`, and
uploads `pod-boot.log` on failure. Running the 55-test suite on every PR was
tried on this branch and reverted: it needs the frontend toolchain, a real
`npm ci` + `npm run build`, `build` in the control plane and a second pod
bring-up on every PR, which is a permanent cost on every contributor for a
suite whose bodies contain no platform branch. The nightly leg carries that
coverage; the label below is how a specific PR buys it for its own revision.

#### Opting a PR in: the `ci:pod-scenarios` label

The job evaluates one expression once, into a job-level env var:

```yaml
env:
  POD_SCENARIOS: ${{ github.event_name == 'pull_request' && contains(github.event.pull_request.labels.*.name, 'ci:pod-scenarios') }}
```

Every step the label pays for carries the identical `if: env.POD_SCENARIOS ==
'true'`: `actions/setup-node` (the repo's pinned SHA, `.nvmrc` major, npm cache
keyed on `website/package-lock.json`), `uv pip install --system build==1.3.0`
(the wheel scenario runs `python -m build --wheel` with `sys.executable` and,
under `KIROCREW_E2E_REQUIRE=1`, fails rather than skips without it), the real
`npm ci` + `npm run build` staged into `src/kiro_crew/static/dist`, and the
suite step itself. The one-file stand-in carries the negation, so a labelled run
serves the built bundle to the boot canary too. The 3-test canary and its
`3 passed` grep run on both paths, unconditionally. The suite step is the
nightly leg's invocation (`-p no:cacheprovider -o addopts= -n0 --timeout=600`)
plus `--basetemp "$RUNNER_TEMP/pod-scenarios-tmp"`, with
`KIROCREW_E2E_SCENARIOS=1` and `KIROCREW_E2E_REQUIRE=1`; pytest's own exit code
is read from `PIPESTATUS[0]` through the `tee`, the anchored `55 passed` grep is
checked first, and that status is returned after it. On failure the
`pod-boot-windows` artifact (7 days) carries `pod-boot.log`, `pod-scenarios.log`
and the plane's `a/**` artifacts and `h/**/*.log` pod logs from under that
basetemp; on a default run the scenario globs simply match nothing.

Three facts about WHEN the label takes effect, all consequences of `ci.yml`
listening only for `push`, `pull_request` (`opened`, `synchronize`,
`reopened`) and `merge_group` -- on which a run has no PR labels, so the suite
stays off -- and deliberately not for `labeled` -- the same choice `ci-full-run`
makes, because a `labeled` trigger re-runs the whole workflow on every bot label:

- The label must be on the PR BEFORE the `opened` or `synchronize` event that
  should run the suite. Apply it, then push (or open the PR).
- Applying the label to an already-open PR triggers nothing by itself.
- Re-running a completed run, in whole or failed-jobs-only, replays that run's
  ORIGINAL event payload, including the label set as of that event. A re-run
  after labelling is still boot-only; a new push is what picks the label up.

`test/test_pod_scenario_matrix.py` pins both shapes: the unlabelled path
contains no Node install, no SPA build, no `build==`, no scenario suite and
still places the stand-in and pins `3 passed`; every step whose text names one of
those carries exactly that one `if`; the gated suite step sets both env markers
and pins `55 passed`. A conditional step that drifts onto a different condition
fails there.

#### The hosted evidence on record

The nightly matrix entry rests on one completed hosted run, made while a
temporary unconditional version of that step existed on this branch:
[run 34744065942, job 103688668718](https://github.com/kirodotdev/KiroCrew/actions/runs/34744065942/job/103688668718)
on `windows-latest`, at revision `c56028aa9`, against the real Vite-built SPA.
Its raw log reports the boot canary at `3 passed` in 76.26s and the full
scenario suite at `55 passed` in 204.76s, exit code 0. That is the evidence
behind removing `windows-latest` from `test/test_pod_scenario_matrix.py`'s
`PENDING_VALIDATION` table. It is evidence for THAT revision. A later revision
that changes a scenario body or the pod code it drives gets its own hosted
Windows evidence either from a labelled PR run or from the nightly; this
document records a run only after it has completed, never in advance.

A subsequent **label-gated PR run** also completed successfully:
[run 34759199939, job 103728957225](https://github.com/kirodotdev/KiroCrew/actions/runs/34759199939/job/103728957225),
at revision `c2f7e39b224c9ab1ddbd2ca970a5b78a947f220e`. The PR label was verified
before the push. The parent review session checked the raw logs: boot canary
`3 passed` in 72.84s at 06:18:13 PDT on 2026-09-13, full scenario suite
`55 passed` in 214.45s at 06:21:49 PDT, and job SUCCESS at 06:22:00 PDT.
This is completed evidence for the labelled path, not merely the historical
unconditional step. It does not root-cause the earlier unavailable-handle
refusal at `312eaca3`, and it does not validate later, unpushed stop repairs.
The strict `55 passed` assertion remains unchanged.

The fixture-level Windows contracts that do run on every PR live in the sharded
unit tests (`test/test_pod_windows*.py`, `test/test_pod_scenario_windows_client.py`)
and in the boot canary above.
