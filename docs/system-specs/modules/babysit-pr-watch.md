# Babysit PR watch

## Purpose

The agent-facing babysit flow prefers `monitor_watch`. It creates a durable,
typed structured monitor through a session-bound directive. The controller probes
the provider before invoking the model, persists canonical observations and
budgets, and wakes the owning session only for a new actionable fingerprint.
Provider-fact-only GitHub review readiness therefore spends no agent turn while
the pull request is unchanged.

How strongly that preference reads is an installation's choice:
`monitoring.prefer_structured_arming` (default off) decides whether the tool
descriptions offer the structured path only once the objective is judged fully
typed-decidable, or name it the default for a supported pull request with the
prompt loop as the exception. It refuses neither tool, and in both positions
evidence the typed provider cannot observe stays on the prompt loop. See
`monitor-architecture.md` for the two costs of defaulting to the structured path.

`monitor_start` creates a finite same-session AutoNudge loop for objectives or
evidence the structured provider cannot decide, including generic comments and
advisory review text. Its stateless directive is validated by
`mcp_tools.control.monitor_start`, then applied by
`dashboard.session_directive_apply._monitor_start` through
`autonudge_authz.authorize_and_add_nudge`. `AutoNudgeService` persists and
schedules the loop. Those two `monitor_start` surfaces are the only callers that
ask for the gate; the chokepoint defaults every other caller UNGATED, the generic
REST route included. Gating is the state that can silently stop work, so a caller
that names no value resolves toward spending a turn per interval rather than toward
a watch that deactivates itself.

A gated loop's WATCHED SUBJECT comes from the two strings it holds, resolved in one
place (`autonudge.infer_subject`, defined in `autonudge_service/subject.py`) so the monitor
and the judge's collector are about
the same pull request. The judge brief's `targets` list is read first, because
`autonudge_judge.parse_targets` reads it first and asks about nothing else once it is
present. A brief naming exactly one public GitHub pull request supplies the subject
when the instruction names none, which is what makes a loop armed as "Babysit PR
13936" with the URL in its brief watchable at all. Otherwise the INSTRUCTION decides:
when it names its own pull request the watch stays on that one even if the brief names
a different one, since a brief naming a blocker is an evidence scope and not a subject
declaration. A brief naming two or more pull requests leaves the instruction deciding,
because a loop holds one monitor. Resolution can answer "no subject", in which case no
probe is attached and the loop fires on its plain interval: an instruction naming a
pull request only in a shorthand (`owner/name#123`, `PR #42`) carries no host and
`#123` is equally an issue reference, and an instruction naming two at once is not
resolved by preferring either. A loop that does resolve to one subject attaches
`PrWatchProbe`, which FETCHES that pull request every tick and hands the reading to
the wake judge. A retarget that changes the subject advances `config_generation`, so a
structural-terminal verdict recorded for the old subject cannot deactivate the new
watch.

There is no script-cron driver. A babysit request uses `monitor_watch` or a finite
`monitor_start` loop owned by the session that can inspect and act on a wake, both
of which run in the gateway -- which is what lets the gated path reach the judge at
all. A cron script runs as a sandboxed subprocess with no gateway credential and no
decisions provider, so a reading made there has nothing to decide with.

A registered script job holding its own copy of the removed driver can still reach
the probe through the installed package, and the probe refuses that context: the
watch identity raises, and because the raise is not a `ValueError` the kernel does
not convert it to `Done`. It propagates instead, so the scheduler counts a failed
run: the message naming `monitor_start` lands in `last_error` and the job is
AUTO-PAUSED once the consecutive-failure threshold is reached. It stays listed,
paused, saying what to arm instead -- the job record is the only durable trace that
the watch was ever armed, so deleting it would take the evidence with the watch.
The alternative to refusing at all is a job that polls on schedule, decides
nothing, and reports nothing, which reads to its owner as a watch still running.
The in-gateway driver marks its own context, so the refusal reaches only the
subprocess path.

### What a gated loop changes about the numbers

`max_cycles` counts DELIVERED cycles, so for a gated loop it bounds delivered
TURNS rather than intervals elapsed -- one field bounding two different quantities
depending on whether inference fired, which any budget UI or operator reasoning
has to know. Not wakes: a wake is only one of the four things that consume the
budget, alongside a streak-floor delivery, a gate fallback and a post-wake
follow-up, so reading the cap as a wake count under-states what it spends.
A gated loop is never starved: after `_MAX_QUIET_STREAK` consecutive quiet
observations it is delivered anyway, counted apart from wakes in `floor_ticks` so
a periodic delivery is never read as a real signal. **That forced delivery is owed
durably, not merely claimed in memory.** The tick that decides it publishes a reset
`quiet_streak`, which is the only record that a turn was due, so a gateway that
stops between the decision and the turn landing would keep the half that suppresses
and lose the half that delivers -- the next tick reads an unchanged subject against
a baseline written for a turn nobody received and answers quiet, pushing the forced
delivery out another whole floor. `MonitorState.floor_fire_pending` carries the debt
across the fire instead: it is set before the write that publishes the reset so the
two ride one snapshot, a later tick finding it set fires WITHOUT observing, and it is
discharged at the single point delivery is confirmed -- the same point that charges
`floor_ticks`. A refusal and a death therefore both leave it owed, and a retried
delivery is charged once. `followup_ticks` is not that backstop: it answers a fire
the slot refused, and a process that stopped refuses nothing.

The debt is served **ahead of** the `followup_ticks` allowance, and consumes one of
its credits when it fires. A refused floor fire leaves both standing for ONE owed
turn -- the allowance so the next tick retries the delivery, the debt recording that
the delivery is still owed -- and both survive a restart while the in-process claim
does not. Behind the allowance, a restart spends the bypass with no claim to charge
and then spends the debt on the tick after, so one owed delivery buys two turns. The
retry the allowance exists for IS the debt's own fire.

Every uncertain path -- no probe, no inferable target, a probe defect, a kernel that
reached no verdict -- fires as before, because a wrongly-quiet tick is silence with
half-finished work behind it while a wrongly-spent tick costs what every tick costs
today.

## Automatic goal pursuit

The agent works on an ordinary human request in the current turn. When continued
work would be useful, `goal(action="suggest")` stores an inactive suggestion with
an objective and completion criteria. The legacy model action `"start"` also
creates only a suggestion. Recognition never arms a loop. Only the authenticated
owner's Start control or an explicit `/goal` command enables continuation.
Simple questions and small tasks need no suggestion. Investigation and design
requests retain their requested deliverable as the finish line. Existing
monitor/watch tasks use those tools directly.

`monitoring.goal_suggestions` defaults to true and is live configurable. Disabling
it removes suggestion guidance and refuses new model proposals at the host,
including after an awaited admission check. It does not stop an existing run or
disable explicit `/goal`. Recognition reuses the ordinary agent turn and adds no
classifier request.

Goal pursuit retains the existing session tool gates and sandbox. Its continuation
prompt preserves `/goal`'s blanket instructions against `git push` and credential
file reads. Starting a goal grants no additional tool permission.

`NudgeLoop.goal` carries the objective, completion criteria, progress, status and
evidence in `autonudge.json`. A suggestion uses that same record with
`status="suggested"`, `active=false`, no deadline and no timer. Reload cannot arm
it. Start carries the observed generation; changed scope or a later Stop refuses
a stale Start. The first accepted Start establishes the runtime anchor. Waiting
for the owner to decide consumes no continuation cycles or runtime.

A goal is an ungated prompt loop, not a structured
monitor or a second task store. Ready work resumes after one second of idle time;
an explicitly waiting goal uses a 60-second cadence. Ordinary watches keep their
existing deadlines. New goals preserve `/goal`'s 50-cycle backstop and zero runtime
budget (no additional wall-clock cap). These are cycle limits, not token or credit
guarantees. Existing stored runtime limits and deadlines survive updates and Resume.
Reaching a backstop pauses work and is not completion.

All four goal text fields use the existing `strip_hidden_unicode` helper before
credential and URL redaction, including direct creation, revision and reload.
Its multilingual shaping and internal newline, carriage-return and tab handling
remain unchanged; direct goal writers do not add NFC normalization.

`GOAL_MAX_OBJECTIVE_CHARS` bounds each objective to 16,000 characters after
redaction at `GoalState` retention, including revisions and store reloads; the
goal tool schema advertises and validates the same input limit. Overflow is
explicitly rejected before mutation, never truncated. This deliberately breaks
the previously unbounded manual `/goal` contract above that limit while
preserving full accepted objectives, including the existing 10–12k-character
cases, through revisions and persistence. Criteria and evidence remain limited
to eight items of 240 characters, and progress to 600 characters after redaction.
The goal tool validates list item types and counts and sanitizes their strings;
item lengths are checked after redaction at retention. Both shared authorizers
accept a continuation over the generic 8,000-character message cap
only when its raw text exactly matches `continuation_message(goal)` for the
supplied typed goal, before normalization or redaction. A mismatched typed
message is refused. All admission, redaction, generation and critical-audit
checks still apply. Generic prompt loops keep their existing message cap.
On reload, the validated typed goal is authoritative for its generated continuation:
a stale stored message is replaced with `continuation_message(goal)`. Startup attempts
to persist this repair, and any cleanup of supplied goal text fields, before arming.
Progress or evidence cleanup also triggers persistence when the continuation is
already canonical; filling an absent optional field alone does not. If that write
fails, it logs the failure and keeps the cleaned goal and canonical message in memory
with the repair still dirty. This repair does
not reset identity, generation, budgets, deadlines or recorded Stop state. Invalid
goal rows retain the existing unparsed-row recovery behavior.
Goal creation and revisions in `autonudge_service/mutations.py` stage their
candidate under the existing store lock
and publish it to status and session inspection only after the write succeeds.
A pending or failed write leaves the last committed goal visible, including a
terminal goal being replaced; a failed first write exposes no new goal.
Successful revisions preserve the live loop object's identity. Stop's explicit
failed-save fallback still pauses the in-memory goal and reports the unsaved warning.
Session Stop uses that mutation owner to resolve each exact primary or explicitly
linked goal binding inside
the same maintenance transaction as creation. It waits for a pending first write
before selecting and pausing the committed row, so an empty pre-commit lookup cannot
let the new goal escape Stop. The pause is shielded from requester cancellation.
Stop acknowledges the saved pause or reports the existing restart-risk warning
when saving fails; a retry persists the retained in-memory pause. Maintenance
quiescing still owns its claimed loops, and goal-less or foreign folded rows remain
untouched.
The goal tool's directive envelope has its own transport limit; progress and
status revisions omit the objective rather than resending or truncating it.

`/goal --max N` keeps its 1–50 cycle range and default of 50. `/goal clear`
removes only the identified typed goal. If the session instead holds a watch,
monitor, or other goal-less loop, it reports that no goal is armed and preserves
that record. Those loops remain manageable through their existing controls.
`off` is ordinary objective text, not a subcommand.
Starting `/goal <objective>` may replace an unstarted suggestion, while preserving
an existing watch or unfinished run;
revise the goal through `goal(action="update")`, or clear it before starting
another. A completed or ended typed goal can be replaced by a new goal.
The success confirmation displays the validated objective returned by the goal consumer.
New pursuit goals use Stop/Pause/Resume instead of creating sentinel files.
Stored goal-less loops retain their instruction, sentinel and budget contracts.
Generic REST edits of a typed goal's instruction or resumption of a finished
goal return an HTTP 409 with code `autonudge_update_refused`.
The stored cycle and runtime limits of a typed goal cannot be changed by an
update; a refused mixed patch changes no fields. Owner-authenticated REST Resume
and human `goal(action="resume")` keep the same objective, progress and remaining
budget. Both refuse spent budgets, while a manual pause or approval stall can
be resumed with budget remaining.
REST Resume supplies the revision observed by the user as `expected_generation`;
the existing store mutation lock checks it before changing any state. Missing or
stale revisions on a typed-goal Resume return HTTP 409; malformed revisions return
HTTP 400, and zero is valid. A later Stop wins over an earlier Resume request,
including a Stop received while the goal is already paused. The native goal tool
retains its existing generation and human-provenance admission checks. Goal-less
Resume remains compatible.
The dashboard calls `api.autonudgeResume`, defined in
`website/src/api/client/monitors.ts` and exposed by the `client.ts` facade.
It uses the facade's shared PATCH transport and response parser, preserving
session authentication, error handling and the captured revision.

`monitor_update`, `monitor_stop` and `autonudge_stop` refuse typed goals and
direct the caller to the goal controls. Generic stop refuses before mutation,
including paused or terminal goals and candidates found through legacy name
normalization; it does not reveal the retained goal. Goal-less legacy deletion
and structured-monitor stop keep their existing behavior.
Both store creation paths preserve an unfinished typed goal, including one
paused by a cycle or runtime limit; `monitor_start` and `monitor_watch` cannot
replace its objective or progress. These checks run before mutation under the
existing store lock, so an outstanding wake cannot renew or replace a goal
after the scheduler pauses it. Completed and ended goals retain the existing
human-started goal replacement path. Goal-less loops keep their existing
budget-edit, bound-revival and stopped-replacement contracts.

The host admits a suggestion only from an authenticated human turn. A model cannot
activate a suggestion through resume or status changes. It can revise the
suggestion, end it, or complete it with evidence when the ordinary turn delivers
the result. Stop retains its unstarted status and invalidates stale Start requests.
Manual `/goal` is marked explicitly by its trusted dispatcher; a model payload
cannot supply that authority.
That goal's own continuation can update progress or finish with evidence, but
cannot invent a new user goal, revise its objective or completion criteria, or
resume a paused one. Any nonhuman mutation containing an `objective` or `criteria`
key is refused in full, even if the value is unchanged or the action also carries
progress, evidence or a status change. Consumed human steering can authorize
those revisions. Updates name the current
goal id and configuration generation; the commit rechecks identity and the
producing turn's Stop state under the existing mutation lock. A failed disk write
rolls back the metadata along with the loop. Completed and ended goals remain
inspectable until the next human goal replaces them. Existing watches and paused
goals are preserved; explicit abandonment uses `goal(action="end")`.
Manual `/goal` carries the runner's live slot and session Stop predicate through
authorization to that same admission check. Replacement checks admission again
after awaited provider-credential cleanup, before removing the old row or
publishing its successor. Refusal retains the old row and restores any provider
credential grant revoked for the uncommitted replacement.
During a Discord or Webex goal wake, a human correction gains goal authority
only after the backend consumption echo matches the registered human steer.
The same goal can then be explicitly ended; automation steers and write
acknowledgements cannot authorize abandonment. A later Stop still wins.
Revisions use the existing update authorizer's critical audit before mutation;
an unavailable audit store refuses the change.

Dashboard Stop pauses future goal turns and cancels the current response.
If storage fails during Stop, pursuit stays paused in the running process and
the save failure is logged. The retained `goal_pause_unsaved` reason, Stop
response, channel reply, and goal panel disclose that a restart may lose the pause.
The panel offers retrying the save rather than resuming work. Only a successful
write acknowledges a saved pause.
Pause releases the store transaction's lock ownership after either a saved pause
or a failed save, allowing a later save retry, Resume or Stop to proceed.
Each failed save retry is acknowledged within the existing single `ErrorNotice`.
The goal panel requires `ok: true` before treating a Stop request as accepted.
A refused Stop uses the existing action failure notice; an accepted Stop whose
status refresh fails remains explicitly unconfirmed.
Repeated Stop invalidates earlier Resume requests without reviving work or
resetting progress and limits. Completed and budget-limited goals keep their
status and stop reasons. Retrying an unsaved pause clears its unsaved marker only
after the write succeeds. If saving fails, the running process retains the
refusal of those earlier requests.
Human steering consumed during an automatic turn can redirect that goal.
Its ingress provenance and admission remain with the pending steer after the
write returns, until consumption, requeue or cancellation settles it.
A broadcast timeout cancels the sender's wait, not the target's pending steer.
The broadcast retains its nonhuman provenance and captured admission until that
input settles; consumption does not grant it human goal authority.
Queue-preserving handovers keep pursuit active; explicit Stop pauses separately.
An empty or unmatched consumption echo, or an automation-origin steer, cannot
grant that authority.
Codex reports consumption only at a clean turn end. If an automatic turn refuses
a goal action while authenticated human steering is pending, that input moves to
the existing queue before the terminal echo can discard it. The queued turn keeps
its original provenance and admission; Stop and queue cancellation still apply.
Successful goal actions and ordinary human turns keep their existing steering
behavior.
The chat's automation control shows a suggestion with a Start action. Its popup
shows the objective, criteria and actual run limits before activation. Started
goals show progress, evidence and pause/resume; users steer in the existing chat.
Turning suggestions off leaves started goals and manual controls available.
The REST and WebSocket projections carry the same goal metadata.
In a dashboard session linked to a channel, Pause targets the visible chat slot
and inspection reads the loop's channel binding.
Goal admission, slash commands, Stop and pause-save warnings share
the exact-binding collection in `goal_actions`, consulting existing slot-bound loops
through the live slot's explicit `linked_session_key`. This prevents a new goal
from arming beside a legacy loop in that same conversation. The singular
`goal_loop_for_session` resolver refuses multiple matching records for inspection,
creation or revision. The authenticated session-monitor endpoint uses this same
resolver for `monitor_inspect` reads, returning HTTP 409
`ambiguous_session_automation` if records conflict. Per-turn goal guidance
contains no retained snapshot and directs state-dependent actions through this
inspection; a failed read leaves state unknown. Stop pauses every typed goal on
those explicit bindings, leaves goal-less watches untouched, and reports an
unsaved pause if any owned goal has one. No inverse mapping is guessed from a normalized slot name: every
candidate, including the primary dashboard binding, must match the stored key
exactly. A legacy row without a live explicit link remains inspectable and
removable by its existing REST id.
Dashboard and channel Stop callers supply their existing state through the Stop
seams, including session lifecycle. A trusted channel reconciliation therefore
does not strand a goal retained under the earlier exact dashboard slot key.
Stop also follows that explicit link when the channel cannot arm new goals;
this does not widen goal creation eligibility. Legacy bare Slack timestamps use
the session layer's existing `canonical_key` shim.
Multiple owned goals do not prevent cancellation of the current response.
An approval stall requires an explicit human retry; Resume uses the existing
retry behavior without granting additional tool permissions. Spent cycle or
runtime budgets remain a backstop.
`needs_input` pauses while a required human answer is missing, `waiting` keeps
checking an existing external operation, and `blocked` records why work cannot
continue. A final assistant response alone never marks the goal complete.
Slack goal continuations use the directive-capable turn driver with the existing
tool gate and approval decider, so their progress and completion reach the same
consumer as an ordinary human turn.

## Same-session monitor contract

`monitor_start`, `monitor_update`, and `autonudge_stop` are session directives,
not direct AutoNudge mutations. `mcp_tools.control` validates the tool payload,
uses strict session-key resolution only as a context guard, and returns an
encoded directive. `dashboard.session_directive_apply.apply_session_directive`
applies that directive on the user-facing session. The split prevents a cron,
hook, or subagent from using inherited process identity to arm, rewrite, or
stop another session's unattended loop; `test_autonudge_stop_auth.py` pins the
binding-key-only targeting and the non-nudgeable-session refusals.

A directive reaches the consumer two ways. On kiro-cli the marker inside the
tool's own RESULT TEXT is decoded under the verified `_meta.kiro` identity. On any
backend that emits no such identity, the MCP stub has already parked the validated
payload on the gateway keyed by `session_directive.call_input_digest` of the raw
`tools/call` arguments, and the consumer claims it by the same digest computed
from the `tool_call` frame's `rawInput` — nothing is read out of the result body,
so a backend that re-serialises, duplicates, offloads or caps that body cannot lose
the directive. `test_session_directive_input_digest.py` drives the real consumer
with every KAS result shape observed so far, and
[agent-host-contract.md](agent-host-contract.md) §9 states what a provider must
declare about its `rawInput`. The consumer-side failure paths log at `warning`
(`session-directive NOT APPLIED`, `NO CALL INPUT`, `CLAIM MISS`, `DENIED`), which
is what makes this class of drop visible in `gateway.log` instead of silent.

`monitor_start` binds one loop to the calling session and is create-only. It
refuses when either automation kind already occupies the binding, preserving the
existing record and its evidence. `monitor_update` is the only way to revise or
re-arm the bound legacy loop. The binding-key and collision tests in
`test_autonudge_stop_auth.py` pin that behavior.

A retained stop is refused at the turn boundary, and the three tools say so
before the turn ends **whenever the retained record is readable**.
`mcp_tools.control._retained_stop_refusal` reads the same
`/api/autonudge/session-monitor` endpoint `monitor_inspect` reads and, when the
binding holds an inactive record whose outcome is retained evidence, returns a
refusal naming the retained outcome, its target, and the owner-only clear —
instead of an ack. This closes a false acknowledgement rather than adding a
capability: the tool answers the model over its own pipe DURING the turn while
`apply_session_directive` runs after the turn's result is processed, so the
authorizer's refusal and the `ARM_REFUSAL_NOTICE_PREFIX` transcript notice both
arrive after the model has ended its turn believing a monitor exists. The
preflight is read-only and fails OPEN — an unreachable gateway arms as before,
because a preflight that failed closed would let one bad read block all arming —
and the turn-boundary refusal remains the enforcement point. So the preflight is
an ADVISORY early answer, not a second gate: on an unreadable read, and in the
TOCTOU window where the record changes after the read, the in-turn answer and the
enforced outcome can still differ, and the turn boundary is what settles it. It
never clears or overwrites a record: clearing retained evidence stays the
owner-only dashboard action. It also runs **only in the MCP server**: a directive
tool's handler is re-run a second time inside the GATEWAY by
`mcp_core.derive_directive`, which discards the returned text, and that replay is
called synchronously on the gateway's own event loop — so the preflight's
blocking loopback read would ask the gateway for an answer only the loop already
waiting on it could give, stalling every co-hosted session until the timeout.
`mcp_core.directive_capture_active` is the seam the guard reads, and the skip
costs nothing: the preflight exists to reach the MODEL in the arming turn, which
only the MCP-side run can do.
`monitoring.models.retained_outcome_blocks_rearm` is
the single predicate shared with `autonudge._stopped_row_is_replaceable`
(`autonudge_service/model.py`), so what
cannot drift is the RULE itself — one outcome classification serves both sites,
rather than two copies diverging. The replaceable/retained split is pinned as
explicit data in `test_monitor_retained_stop_false_ack.py`, because a test that
merely compares the two callers of one predicate is tautological. That file also
covers all three tools, the fail-open paths, the system-imposed outcomes that
must still arm, and the endpoint wire contract the refusal depends on — dropping
`outcome` from `MONITOR_PUBLIC_FIELDS` would make the preflight fail open
silently.

`NudgeLoop.next_due_ts`, `notify_user_input`, and `notify_turn_complete` make
dashboard-loop cadence deadline-preserving: user activity cancels a pending
timer but does not move its deadline, and a delivered nudge begins its next
full interval when that nudge turn ends. This prevents active conversation
from postponing monitoring forever while avoiding a nudge racing a user turn;
`test_autonudge_deadline.py::test_user_turn_resumes_remaining_time_not_full_interval`
and `test_delivered_fire_clears_deadline_then_turn_end_starts_fresh` pin both
sides of the contract. Channel-bound loops re-arm after their unattended turn
in `AutoNudgeService._run_fire_cycle` (`autonudge_service/firing.py`) because they do not
use the dashboard
turn-lifecycle hooks.

The schemas in `validation.MONITOR_START_SCHEMA` and
`validation.MONITOR_UPDATE_SCHEMA` bound the message, interval, cycle cap, and
wall-clock budget. `mcp_tools.control.monitor_start` supplies bounded positive
defaults from `mcp_tools._limits`; zero and negative cycle or runtime limits are
rejected. The operator ceiling is `monitoring.max_runtime_secs`; setting 2592000
permits a 30-day request without extending existing loops. The cap is a runaway backstop, not evidence that the watched work
completed: `AutoNudgeService._timer` (`autonudge_service/firing.py`) deactivates a capped
loop and emits
`expired`.

`autonudge.runtime_budget_exceeded` (a module function in `autonudge_service/model.py`)
measures a configured wall-clock
budget from the persisted creation time. `_timer` checks it before a fire and
`_run_fire_cycle` checks it after a delivered turn, so a running turn is not
cancelled but an expired loop is not re-armed. `test_autonudge.py` pins budget
persistence across restart and the post-delivery check.

`monitor_update` resolves the loop only by the calling session's binding and
patches its message or limits through `authorize_and_update_nudge`. It does
not accept a loop identifier. `_monitor_update` refuses a new cap or budget
that cannot yield another fire and never revives a manual pause as a side
effect. It may re-arm a loop stopped by its own cycle cap or runtime budget
only when the relevant bound is raised, from a user turn or from the loop's own
delivered wake; a wake cannot revive a loop a person stopped or paused. The
paused-loop and bound-revival tests in `test_autonudge_stop_auth.py` pin those
distinctions.

A delivered wake may arm a monitor (`monitor_start`, `monitor_watch`) only
while the loop that fired it is still its own: the wake carries that loop's id,
and `apply_session_directive` reads the row back before the authorizer runs. A
row that is gone (a prompt-loop Stop removes it) or that a person stopped (a
retained `USER_STOP` record, a manual pause, an empty reason) refuses the arm; a
row that is active, or that its own cycle cap, runtime budget, terminal subject
or dropped sentinel deactivated, admits it, and the create-only and
`replace_stopped` rules then decide as for any other arm. The self-arm tests in
`test_autonudge_member_self_arm.py` and `test_monitor_directive_apply.py` pin
the four answers. When the wake carries a loop id, its `monitor_update`,
`monitor_stop`, and `autonudge_stop` directives apply only while that id is the
monitor currently bound to the session; a replacement monitor is never mutated
by the stale wake. For a legacy loop, the identity, binding, and person-stop
retention checks are repeated inside the same service transaction that removes
the row or writes the research tombstone, so a pause landing after the early
refusal check survives unchanged. When that transaction finds the row missing,
it checks the slot in the same hold: a slot with no loop means the stop's goal
already holds and it succeeds, while a slot holding a different loop means a
concurrent arm replaced it, so the stop is refused and the replacement keeps
running. A write that never takes the lock is reported as not stopped. A
structured monitor needs no such repeat: its
stop already runs under the service lock and returns a row that carries a
retained outcome untouched.

`autonudge_stop` is deliberately non-confirming at tool-call time because the
consumer applies it after the turn result is processed. The applier removes an
ordinary monitor loop on the calling binding and reports an idempotent local
miss. It never exposes a cross-session target; `test_autonudge_stop_auth.py`
pins both the request wording and the local-binding behavior.

## PR fetcher

`probes.gh_pr` reads one pull request and makes no wake decision. Whether a tick
is worth the owning session's turn is the wake judge's answer, read against the
loop's own criteria; the one deterministic mapping -- a merged or closed pull
request ends the watch -- belongs to the auto-nudge core, which is the layer that
can act on it. `PrWatchProbe.observe` therefore returns NO observations. The
reading is published on the probe instance and the driver reads it there.

`_parse_config` accepts a JSON message naming one repository, one pull request,
and optionally the one pinnable host. A message that can never be valid raises
`ValueError`, which the driver converts to a removed watch rather than a retried
tick. Keys this build does not read are ignored, so a watch armed by an earlier
build keeps working. `test_gh_pr_fetch.py` pins both rules.

Every call goes through `_Transport`, one object per tick, which owns:

* `github_runner.resolve_gh` and `github_runner.run_gh` -- the repo's single gh
  spawn chokepoint: the validated absolute path, the restricted GitHub
  environment, an SEL audit record per spawn, and the pinned host that stops an
  ambient `GH_HOST` re-pointing a bare `owner/name` slug at another server.
* A per-call timeout under a whole-tick budget, so a paginated read cannot spend
  the product of the two.
* Bounded retry with exponential backoff and full jitter. Jitter matters because
  several loops on one host tick on the same cadence. A refusal that names itself
  and is not transient is answered once rather than retried.
* Rate limits read off the response headers (`gh api --include`), so a call backs
  off on a nearly-spent window instead of discovering the floor by being refused.
  `retry-after` wins over the reset epoch, and every wait is capped.

The reading itself:

* Check runs are paginated against the API's own `total_count`. That count is why
  this reads the check-runs endpoint rather than the rollup served beside the pull
  request: the rollup is a bare array, so a truncated read of it is undetectable.
  Commit statuses are a separate sequence read the same way and by the same code,
  because a required gate can be published as one and appears on no check-runs page
  -- and a first-page-only read of them omits exactly the rows most likely to be
  gating, with nothing else on the reading saying so. The two share one function on
  purpose: two copies of a counted read is how one of them ends up without the count
  check, and that one is a failing gate missing from a board reporting itself whole.
* `_collapse` folds duplicate rows to one per identity, newest by start time, and
  reports how many raw rows it folded. An unknown conclusion is reported as
  `unknown`; a cancelled or stale row as `superseded`.
* The identity a row folds under is its WORKFLOW, not the app that posted it. Every
  GitHub Actions row carries one app slug, so the slug cannot separate two workflow
  files that each define a job of the same name, and folding those lets one
  workflow's green stand in for the other's failure on a board still reporting
  itself whole. So an Actions row is qualified by its workflow and by nothing when
  that is unknown: the slug would be a false qualifier, reading as "one lane" on
  exactly the rows it cannot tell apart.
* The workflow is resolved only where a check name is SHARED between two runs, which
  is the only case that needs it -- either two workflow files that must stay two
  rows, or two runs of one workflow that must fold, and nothing else on the row says
  which. An unshared name needs no qualifier, so the ordinary board resolves nothing
  and spends no call: measured at 40 rows across 19 runs with no name shared, where
  resolving every run would cost 19 calls a tick to separate nothing. Where a shared
  name cannot be resolved, recency stops meaning supersession for that identity: the
  conservative bucket is kept and the reading reports itself `partial` with a note
  naming the unresolved identity. A redundant look costs a turn, a dropped gate
  costs the merge.
* A duplicate that cannot be ordered by time keeps the more conservative bucket.
  Saying so is the READING's job rather than the row's: `partial` and its note are
  what a consumer reads, and a per-row flag none of them opens would be a field
  the reading cannot back.
* Comments and reviews are carried WITH their bodies, clipped per item and in
  total, newest first, inside a fetch horizon. The bot's own comments are skipped,
  because otherwise the watch is a feedback loop. A remark whose timestamp cannot
  be read is left out: an age of unknown freshness would be carried every tick.
* One `status` per reading: `ok` when every page was read, `partial` when something
  was read and something was not, `unavailable` when the subject was not reached.
  A refusal becomes a status, never an exception. A consumer treats `partial` as a
  target nobody read whole, which fires.
* `as_facts` is the durable half -- typed facts plus who said something and when.
  `bodies` is a separate call, so keeping the first cannot accidentally keep the
  second: remark prose stays in the process that fetched it. Each remark does carry a
  short digest of its body, because the prose is gone after the tick and a record
  saying only that a remark existed leaves a WRONG quiet unexaminable -- the digest
  identifies what was screened without storing it. Every key in the durable half has
  a reader; the transport's own counters are not there, since they describe the fetch
  rather than the subject and this record is written every tick into the budget the
  judge's evidence must fit inside.
* A check run and a commit status are separate sequences in the forge's own model, so
  the fold identity carries which family a row came from and the two never merge. The
  pair that would otherwise merge is ordinary output: a status with no target URL
  carries no qualifier, and neither does a check run whose name needed no resolution.

The kernel is still in the path for what a stateless reading cannot hold: the
epoch, so its dedupe memory resets on a new head, and the consecutive-failure
backstop, which turns a run of unreadable ticks into one report that the watch is
blind.

## Watch kernel invariants

`irq.state_path` includes the subject identity and cron job identifier. Two
jobs watching one PR therefore do not suppress each other's alerts. `load_state`
treats missing or malformed state as fresh and `save_state` uses `atomic_write`;
the degradation is a possible duplicate wake, not a crash-loop. If persistence
fails while a coalescing window is open, `irq.run` reports immediately with a
warning rather than delaying an observation into state it cannot recover.

A `Tick.epoch` changes when the PR head changes. `irq.run` clears
`REVISION` dedupe and coalescing state on that change, so failures on the new
head can wake again. Conversation observations set `resets_on=ResetsOn.NEVER`, so
a force-push does not replay an already-seen comment or review. These distinct
key spaces are load-bearing: treating every signal as head-scoped loses
conversation dedupe, while treating every signal as sticky hides failures on a
new head.

`irq.run` coalesces ordinary wake observations until the configured floor has
elapsed and the check rollup settles, or until its hard wall elapses. The hard
wall ensures a permanently pending check delays a wake instead of losing it.
Sticky conversation observations can fire once the floor elapses even while
checks remain pending; they do not become more informative by waiting for CI.
`Severity.IMMEDIATE` and `Severity.TERMINAL` bypass the ordinary window. The
coalescing and sticky-observation tests in `test_irq.py` pin these cases.

Dedupe is time-bounded. The kernel re-alerts a persistent condition after its
window because a script cannot observe whether gateway delivery succeeded;
permanent acknowledgement could turn one lost delivery into permanent silence.
The fetcher emits no observations, so nothing of its own is deduped here; the
kernel's dedupe serves the reports it raises itself. `test_irq.py` pins those.

`Tick(fetch_ok=False)` increments the kernel-owned error streak. A persistent
failure reports that the watch is blind; a successful fetch clears the streak
and its blind marker. If state cannot be written, the kernel reports on the
first failed tick because a counted threshold would otherwise be unreachable.
The watch-health tests in `test_irq.py` pin recovery, re-alerting, and the
unwritable-state path; `test_gh_pr_fetch.py` pins that an unreadable reading is
what reaches the kernel as a failed tick.

## Delivery and lifecycle

Script cron execution maps `Skip` to no delivery, `Report` to a result while
keeping the job, and `Done` to a result whose successful delivery removes the
job. The script-cron branch in `slack.gateway._init_cron` delivers a result to
the originating dashboard slot, queues it if that slot is busy, and rehydrates
a closed slot from history when possible. If no slot is available, it sends a
notification instead. This makes the arming session the normal wake target
without claiming that headless delivery can start a session.

The bundled script is a source asset, not a gateway import. Existing jobs must
still resolve a registered copy under the configured cron directory through
`cron_script.resolve_script_path`. The cron gateway revalidates and scans that
current script body at fire time, then executes it through the script sandbox.
The babysit skill no longer registers new script jobs.

## Non-goals

The structured GitHub monitor digests PR-level comment bodies to detect that
one changed, so an in-place edit whose `created_at` never moves still wakes the
owner. It never interprets what a comment says or decides whether an advisory
finding is valid, and it deliberately does not read inline review-thread bodies
at all -- it reports only the count of unresolved, non-outdated threads there. It
reports typed provider facts and leaves judgment, source inspection, and any
reply to the reactivated babysit session.
`monitor_start` remains appropriate when each delivered cycle requires the agent
to make progress, the objective requires untyped evidence, or the watched subject
is unsupported by a structured provider.
