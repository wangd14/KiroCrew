# Slack Gateway Module

## Overview

The Slack integration (`kiro_crew/slack/`) connects KiroCrew to Slack via Socket Mode. DMs are routed through ACP to kiro-cli with real-time streaming and interactive tool approval.

Independently scheduled agent runs admit their exact execution key as durable
work before provider allocation, publishing its privacy mode in the canonical
session execution record. Single and sequential-agent paths share that
admission, so first-turn child creation does not require a dashboard slot or a
previous transcript. A damaged committed mode refuses allocation; a key prefix
alone never grants a mode. Origin-chat injection keeps the chat's own policy.
Cron execution binding is published off the event loop before mode admission
and provider allocation, using the run's already captured execution context.

Startup wires memory objects behind one gateway-lifetime in-process barrier.
Both dashboard and API-only servers receive the orchestrator's existing context
builder. Post-bind workflow initialization uses that same object for essentials
and store-bound context; it does not construct a second memory stack or add
pre-bind memory reads.
After the dashboard binds, one tracked worker activates pending V1 and V2 restores before opening any memory database or
markdown/FTS store. It clears a previous gateway's cached handles, initializes the
already-wired Global store and rebuilds FTS before releasing memory access.
The gateway publishes that task to dashboard state and emits `KIROCREW_READY`
without yielding to it, then awaits it before arming cron, heartbeat, automatic
memory work or channel transports. Persisted Crew work and restored legacy
channel agents resume after the same wait. Agent-backed dashboard turns shield-wait on
the same task at their central admission seam before identity, provider or
metadata work. A cancelled turn therefore cannot cancel preparation or record
the transient fence as a failed turn. The bound dashboard remains available for
status and recovery while preparation runs; its memory content operations
refuse access until the pass settles. A journal or
activation failure is recorded against that canonical store, and the worker
continues restoring later stores. Once the pass completes, healthy Global,
named V1 and private V2 stores become usable independently. A Global restore or
initialization failure fences only Global and skips its migration; private
repair and automatic backups of healthy member V2 stores still run. Structural configuration or worker
initialization failure can keep the whole preparing fence closed.
Failed-store context, HTTP, direct/cached store handles and backups refuse with
a named reason; HTTP returns `503` and `code: store_unavailable`.
Store status, backup listing and cancellation remain available for owner recovery.
Failure preserves the journal and prior data. Owner backup and cancellation
responses report `activation_failed`, `restore_error` and `restart_required`
for the affected store, even when its journal parses or has been cancelled.
Cancellation does not unlock that store in this gateway; a subsequent restart
retries recovery before access. Once the preparing pass completes, an owner can
stage a known-good backup for a failed store, including when its current database
is unreadable. Staging validates ownership and the backup without opening live
memory, and retains the existing pending-journal lock. It does not clear the
failure fence or activate that copy until the next restart. Preparing, stopped
and structurally failed gateways still refuse new staging.
The failure map is process-local and lasts only
for that gateway. V2 product store users hold a shared POSIX admission lock outside the replaceable directory; restore activation requires the exclusive lock. Windows relies on native open-handle replacement refusal. This does not claim coordination with arbitrary external writers that bypass the product protocol. A stopped worker
closes any late handle before its barrier is released and cannot release a
successor gateway's barrier.

After successful memory readiness, one gateway-owned repair loop visits the
active Global store and cached named V1/V2 stores in round-robin order every 30
seconds on the embedding executor. Each visit revalidates readiness and the
named store's declaration and ownership, uses only an already-ready backend and
repairs at most 16 missing vectors per memory kind using existing bulk pacing.
Bounded cursor pages move past failed rows and wrap for retries. Later seeds,
queued writes and model reconciliation therefore receive repair without a
restart. Successful pages append to the resident native index instead of rebuilding and writing the entire index on every page. Shutdown stops new visits and fences late embedding commits. The loop
waits for Global's boot migration and full repair sweep before visiting that
store, never opens a store and adds no per-member task or model load. V1
retrieval, admission, decay, consolidation and capacity behavior remain
unchanged.

The first heartbeat after memory becomes ready schedules a tracked background
backup pass for every active memory store: the default store first, then declared
named V1 stores and active member V2 stores.
Existing per-store backup freshness prevents duplicate copies across
restarts; later checks retain the daily cadence at tick 30 modulo 1440. A large
store does not delay subsequent heartbeat ticks or idle-session checks.
Only one backup pass belongs to a heartbeat service at a time. Shutdown signals
its worker to finish at most the current atomic copy, then skip pruning and all
remaining stores. Stopping the async waiter never resets that worker's stop flag.
Automatic backup enumeration excludes archived, unbound private stores.
Manual all-store backups visit the same set. Archived files
and backup listings remain available for owner inspection; restore requires an
active exclusive binding and there is no archive reattachment UI.

Explicit member deletion and committed package-agent pruning release that store's
SQLite handle, FAISS/scoring arrays and markdown/lesson caches off the event loop.
An in-flight construction cannot republish a handle across the cache's eviction
generation. Existing files and rollback copies remain intact; recreating a member
receives a fresh store identity. Superseded restore trees remain outside automatic
`backup_keep` retention and require explicit owner cleanup. Their UUID names and
file timestamps do not establish completed recovery or safe deletion order.

During operation, member cron jobs, linked DMs, nudges and completion injections validate
their own recorded memory identity before acquiring a provider. Completion
injections use the parent conversation's memory; delegates keep their target's
member-scoped memory for the delegated run and retries.

Memory-operation refusals retain their named recovery reason in channel replies,
but pass through the shared credential/exfiltration and local-path redactors
before truncation. Both native Slack and its transport dispatcher apply the same
protection as Discord and Telegram. Native Slack sanitizes the accumulated reply
before final rendering and conversation persistence; an operating-system error
must not expose its data-home path to channel readers.

Native and transport Slack dispatch resolve persisted agent/project overrides
off-loop. Only the event loop updates the live override maps, retaining a newer
command or completed hydration that arrived during the read. Both dispatch paths
recheck thread ownership after hydration and store admission before provider
allocation. Unlinking returns to the canonical Slack conversation; pinned answers
retain their asker. Transport also retains its privacy-boundary owner check.
Cached overrides keep the existing synchronous no-I/O fast path.

**Thread parent for a new Slack-born session.** A reply can open a Slack-born
session (`slack:<ts>`) in a thread it did not start: the owner answering an
agent's `send_message(session="slack")` DM, a reply under a cron post, a reply
in someone else's channel thread. When that session is fresh and its transcript
has no user or assistant row yet, both dispatch paths read the thread's first
message once (`slack/thread_parent.py`, via `SlackClientOps.fetch_message_detail`):

- The model gets it only as `thread_parent_text`, inside the fenced,
  injection-screened `[SLACK THREAD CONTEXT — UNTRUSTED DATA]` block. A parent
  matching an injection pattern stays withheld there.
- The transcript gets one `notice` row above the reply, attributed to its author
  (the posting app's name, else the user's real name), which the dashboard draws
  as a notice card with its line breaks kept. A `notice` is display-only
  (`history_projection.DISPLAY_ONLY_ROLES`): it is outside `RECALL_ROLES`, and
  `recent_with_provenance`, memory consolidation and auto-skill detection skip it,
  so no replay, recall, compression or memory pass hands it to a model.
  Consolidation still moves its offset past the row. An injection-matching
  parent's text is withheld from the row too, and the row's text goes through the
  prompt block's marker neutralizers. Incognito and temporary sessions get no row.

Dashboard-linked threads and sessions with prior turns fetch and record nothing.
The transport path persists the user's row at receipt, so it builds the prompt
with `exclude_last_n=1`; otherwise the history fallback replays the reply as the
thread's history.

## Architecture

Channel startup diagnostics receive setting names and boolean presence checks,
never credential values. Each channel keeps its existing enablement predicate;
missing settings are named once, and configured or disabled channels stay silent.

```
Slack Socket Mode → events.py (dispatch) → handler.py → SessionManager → AcpClient → kiro-cli
                  ↘ interactive payloads → interactions.py (dispatch) → approve/reject/ack
                  ↘ member_joined_channel → allowlist.py (prompt_allowlist) → owner DM
```

| `slack/sessions_view.py` | Slack half of the recent-sessions list shared by the slash command, the DM keyword and the App Home tab; collection lives in `messaging/sessions_view.py` |
| `slack/thread_parent.py` | The first message of a thread a new Slack-born session was opened in: fetched once for the fenced prompt block and recorded once as a display-only `notice` transcript row (see "Thread parent for a new Slack-born session") |

## APIs

### Slack App OAuth Contract

The bundled `slack-manifest.yaml` is the setup source of truth. Its bot scopes
are `app_mentions:read`, `channels:history`, `channels:read`, `chat:write`,
`commands`, `files:read`, `files:write`, `groups:history`, `groups:read`,
`im:history`, `im:read`, `im:write`, `reactions:write`, and `users:read`.
`message.groups` is subscribed alongside `message.channels` so private-channel
turns and thread continuation are delivered.

The manifest also requests user scopes `channels:history`, `channels:read`,
`groups:history`, `groups:read`, `im:history`, `im:read`, `mpim:history`,
`mpim:read`, `search:read`, and `users:read`. These scopes apply only to a
separately configured Slack MCP/search integration's `xoxp-...` token. The
gateway constructs every Slack client with `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN`; it does not read
or store the user token.

### `run_gateway(cfg: KiroCrewConfig, *, no_dashboard=False, no_crons=False) -> None`
Starts the Socket Mode listener. Blocks until SIGINT/SIGTERM. When `no_crons=True`, the `CronService` is instantiated but not started — cron jobs are visible in the dashboard but not executed. Use for multi-instance setups where a single primary instance handles cron execution. On shutdown, calls `dashboard_state.close_all_ws()` before `AppRunner.cleanup()` to prevent 30s hang from blocked WebSocket `async for msg` loops.

### Restart after update

Automatic-update restarts select and validate the composed gateway launcher before
saving state or draining callbacks/sessions. Without a launcher they retain the
core-managed interpreter resolver loaded before apply. Launcher selection and the
companion integration contract are defined in
[platform-context](platform-context.md#gateway-restart-launcher); the callback
fence and final yield-free drain-to-exec handoff apply to both launch paths.

Both launch paths, and the dashboard's own `/api/restart`, reach `os.execv` through
`platform_compat.reexec_launcher` / `reexec_python_module`, and those seams cancel
the loop-stall alarm (`arm_process_alarm(0)`) immediately before the exec, with no
await in between: `execve` preserves `ITIMER_REAL` while it resets a caught
`SIGALRM` to its default disposition, so the deadline the last heartbeat armed
would otherwise reach the successor gateway as a lethal signal it never armed,
during its own boot, with no dump and no log line. The successor clears its own
side too: the `gateway` entrypoint calls `loop_watchdog.disarm_inherited_alarm()`
as soon as faulthandler is enabled, cancelling any deadline that still arrived,
but only while `SIGALRM` is at its default disposition (the same ownership rule
`exit_mechanism()` applies: a Python handler on `SIGALRM` means another owner's
`ITIMER_REAL`, which is left alone).

### Shutdown Sequence

1. First Ctrl+C sets `shutdown_event` → graceful shutdown begins (10s deadline)
2. Second Ctrl+C calls `os._exit(0)` immediately (force exit)
3. `_shutdown()` **first disarms the loop-stall watchdog** (`dashboard_state._loop_watchdog.stop()` + cancels `_loop_heartbeat`), then saves active chat slots, cancels handler tasks, stops cron/heartbeat, closes sessions. The watchdog MUST be disarmed before `close_all()`/`cancel_all()` because that teardown deliberately kills every kiro-cli child — the same `os.waitpid` reaping burst the watchdog guards against — and a slow teardown would otherwise let the armed stall alarm (`setitimer(ITIMER_REAL)` with faulthandler's `SIGALRM` handler) end the process mid-shutdown (a clean quit would look like a crash). The watchdog's own `on_cleanup` hook fires too late (inside `AppRunner.cleanup()`, gathered concurrently with the reaping).
4. The gateway clears its port-keyed run marker in both dashboard and API-only
   modes, then `cleanup_orphaned_sessions()` kills any kiro-cli PIDs tracked in
   the PID file before `os._exit(0)`.

**Self-initiated exits carry a non-zero status.** `_shutdown_and_exit` composes
`shutdown_exit_code(watchdog) or listener_guard_exit_code(...)`, so an operator
stop still exits 0 while a shutdown the gateway asked for itself does not —
a restart-on-failure supervisor never relaunches an exit 0:

| Status | Source | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | operator (SIGTERM, `systemctl stop`, Ctrl+C) | stay down as asked |
| 75 (`EX_TEMPFAIL`) | stale-asset watchdog | the served assets vanished |
| 69 (`EX_UNAVAILABLE`) | listener guard (`dashboard/listener_guard.py`) | the TCP listener could not be restored, so the process was alive but unreachable |
| 78 (`EX_CONFIG`) | gateway lock refusal (`gateway_lock.LIVE_HOLDER_EXIT_CODE`), before the gateway runs — not a shutdown | the serving-holder predicate (`GatewayLock._serving_verdict`) is True: the process `/proc/locks` positively identifies as holding `gateway.lock` is running, holds the configured dashboard port with its OWN socket at the address this gateway is configured to bind, and answers HTTP there — a sibling gateway already serves this home. The systemd unit's `RestartPreventExitStatus=` names this one status so it is NOT relaunched (see [cli](cli.md), *Service Management*); every other lock refusal — a holder no surface can identify, however the recorded pid looks; a holder whose own socket at the probed address is silent (a wedged gateway); a holder on the port only at another address, or one the platform did not report (the residual row, unasserted by design, so a stranger's answer there is never credited to it) among them — exits 1 and is relaunched |

The listener-guard path is Windows-only in practice: CPython's proactor loop
closes the LISTEN socket after one failed `accept()` and never re-arms it. The
guard rebinds first and only sets this status when rebinding keeps failing, or
when the rebind binds yet the loopback `/api/live` probe still gets no answer —
a state no rebind can fix.

### Event-loop stall watchdog & blocking-work executors

The gateway runs a single asyncio loop, so any blocking call on the loop thread freezes the whole backend. App Home skill loader construction and listing run together in a worker: listing can initialize/read the persistent SQLite metadata index. Two mechanisms contain this (see `dashboard/loop_watchdog.py`, `executors.py`):

- **`LoopStallWatchdog`** — armed only when `faulthandler.is_enabled()` (the real `gateway` entrypoint; not `chat`/`tui`). The async heartbeat (`dashboard/server.py`, 5s interval) `beat()`s it each tick, re-arming the kernel's per-process alarm (`setitimer(ITIMER_REAL)` for `exit_after` seconds, `platform_compat.arm_process_alarm`) with `faulthandler.register(SIGALRM, chain=True)` on the crash-dump file: if the loop goes silent, the alarm dumps all thread stacks from inside the signal handler — in C, with no GIL, so it fires whether the loop thread is blocked in a syscall or holding the GIL inside a long C call — and then hands `SIGALRM` to its default disposition, which ends the process. **A suspend is not a stall:** the alarm pauses while the host sleeps (Linux runs `ITIMER_REAL` on `CLOCK_MONOTONIC`; macOS schedules it on the absolute mach timebase), and the loop's own monotonic clock stands still too, so a laptop resume misses no beat and fires no deadline. faulthandler's own `dump_traceback_later` timer cannot be that decider on every platform: it waits on an interpreter lock whose deadline clock is fixed when CPython is built (`sem_clockwait(CLOCK_MONOTONIC)` with `HAVE_SEM_CLOCKWAIT`, otherwise `sem_timedwait` on `CLOCK_REALTIME`, which jumps by the whole suspend on resume and fires any pending deadline the instant the host wakes, whatever its budget — the branch every portable interpreter build and every macOS build takes). Windows has no process alarm, and a process that already handles `SIGALRM` from Python (pytest-timeout in a test worker, an embedding host) owns `ITIMER_REAL` too; in both cases that timer carries the exit at the same budget and the alarm is never armed or cancelled (`exit_mechanism()`; the startup line says `exit_after=<budget> (alarm|faulthandler)`). The mechanism is decided once per arm and latched (`_armed_mechanism`), and each beat's cancel targets the latched one, so a `SIGALRM` owner that appears between two beats moves the exit onto faulthandler's timer at the next re-arm instead of leaving the pending alarm to fire beside it. Each alarm arm releases faulthandler's `SIGALRM` registration and registers it afresh: a repeat `faulthandler.register` reinstalls nothing while faulthandler believes it still holds the signal, so a temporary owner that handed `SIGALRM` back with `SIG_DFL` would otherwise leave the next alarm to end the process without a dump. On Windows nothing new is lost: its `time.monotonic()` counts a sleep as well, so a sleep already reads as silence there. The exit is by `SIGALRM` rather than status 1 and the dump carries no `Timeout (` preamble line; no consumer of either exists. `SIGALRM` and `ITIMER_REAL` belong to the watchdog in the gateway process, and to no successor image: the exec seams cancel the alarm before `os.execv` and the successor's entrypoint clears any deadline that still arrived (see "Restart after update"). A daemon thread measures the silence since the last beat on the **monotonic clock** (`time.monotonic()`) for the observability layer — enrichment, then the soft dump — on its 5s poll; each poll also samples the suspend-inclusive clock `platform_compat.boottime_now` (`CLOCK_BOOTTIME` on Linux, the wall clock on macOS, `None` where none exists) and an advance there of `SUSPEND_SKEW_MIN_SECS` (2s) or more beyond the monotonic advance is logged once at INFO as a resume; it decides no exit. Desktop/foreground launches automatically use 25s; managed systemd/launchd gateways automatically use 90s because they have no Electron probe and WSL, VM, or heavy disk pressure can suspend scheduling long enough to make 25s a false death. The config value is nullable/automatic so an unrelated full config save cannot pin either launch-class default; any explicit `dashboard.loop_stall_exit_after_secs` value, including 25, overrides both. Older full-config saves may have materialized the former 25-second default; Kiro Crew reports that through the read-only superseded-default warning and `doctor` rather than guessing whether the value was deliberate. The managed path emits a non-fatal all-thread dump to stderr at `stall_after=30s`, never to the fatal crash-sentinel file, then exits at its service budget if the loop has not recovered. If the alarm is off (`exit_after=None`) or fails to arm or re-arm, no fatal capture can follow, so that soft-only dump is written to the dedicated dump file as well as stderr to remain discoverable. `KIROCREW_SERVICE_MANAGED=1` in the generated systemd unit or launchd plist is the sole managed-launch authority; inherited systemd metadata is deliberately ignored because descendants receive it too. `kirocrew doctor` detects an installed definition without the marker and tells the operator to run `kirocrew service install` once to regenerate it and adopt the managed-service default.
- **Bounded executors** — blocking maintenance work is offloaded off the default executor (which the loop uses for DNS) into two separate bounded pools: `maintenance_executor()` (`mc-maint`, fast orphan-reaping sweeps + agent-overlay rewrites) and `cron_executor()` (`mc-cron`, long/concurrent cron command & script jobs). Kept separate so a burst of cron jobs cannot starve the orphan sweeps. MCP `probe_all()` fan-out is bounded by `asyncio.Semaphore(5)`.
- **`init_socket_mode` is a coroutine awaited ON the loop, never offloaded whole** — `WSSocketModeClient.__init__` ends in `asyncio.ensure_future`, which requires a current event loop in the constructing thread, so running the function in a `to_thread` worker crashes every Slack-enabled boot with `RuntimeError: There is no current event loop` (the #7518 regression; under systemd the unit crash-loops into `StartLimitBurst` and stays `failed`). Its two blocking calls — the YOLO grant's profiles-dir walk (`set_yolo_mode` → `grant_declared_yolo`) and the enterprise `auth.test` network call (`validate_enterprise`) — are offloaded individually *inside* the coroutine, which keeps the security-relevant early-return ordering (owner check → YOLO grant → enterprise validation) intact. Pinned by `test_slack_events_coverage.py::TestInitSocketMode` — including a test that constructs the **real** `WSSocketModeClient` (a mocked constructor is how the regression slipped past CI) and a source-level pin refusing `to_thread(init_socket_mode, ...)` at the gateway call site.

### `handle_message(slack, sessions, channel, text, thread_ts, msg_ts, user_id, approval_mode, ..., subagent_manager) -> None`
Processes a single incoming message with streaming:

**Session key discipline:** the handler derives two values at entry —
`reply_ts = thread_ts or msg_ts` (the bare Slack thread timestamp, used for
posting replies and as the key of thread-indexed maps: `SessionMap`'s
thread→session index and the dashboard `_slack_to_slot` map) and
`session_key = canonical_key(reply_ts)` (the namespaced `slack:<ts>` form,
used for everything session-scoped: `SessionManager` registry, conversation
log, per-thread override maps, trust set). The canonical form is stable
across all messages of a thread; the legacy bare form is folded onto the same
live session by `SessionManager._fold_key` (see session.md).

`slack.dm_single_session` (default off) splits those two for a 1:1 DM. A
message in a `D…` channel runs under `slack:<channel_id>` —
`flat_dm_session_key`, one session for the whole DM instead of one per
message — and a top-level message posts at channel root, so `post_thread_ts` is
`None` while `reply_ts` keeps its thread-index and reaction meaning. A THREADED
reply in that DM joins the same session: in a 1:1 DM a thread is a layout habit
rather than a new topic, so splitting it off would leave the branch without the
conversation it answers. Only the session merges — the reply, the `!stop` ack and
a privacy modifier's confirmation all still post where they were addressed, back
inside the thread. The session is bound to
the channel (`set_channel`) and NOT to a thread: a flat conversation has no
thread for `set_slack_link` to claim, claiming one would give the dashboard
mirror a thread to post into while the conversation itself is flat, and with
several threads the scalar `slack_thread_ts` would flip to whichever spoke last.
Routing needs no claim regardless: the flat key is DERIVED from the channel, so
it is recomputed rather than looked up. That holds
for every writer of the link, not just the turn's own self-link:
`maybe_apply_privacy_modifiers` takes a separate `link_thread` flag, which is
false in flat mode, so `!temporary` / `!incognito` register no thread while still
confirming in place. A thread already claimed by its own per-thread session — the
shape this feature replaces, e.g. from before the flag was on — is ignored so it
cannot pull the turn back out of the merged conversation; any OTHER owner (a
dashboard send-to-Slack) still wins.
Group channels and group DMs (`mpim`) are excluded — a thread there is
a deliberate scope boundary, and an `mpim` is shared with other people. The key
keeps the two-segment `slack:<scope>` shape on purpose, so callers that treat a
Slack key as opaque or reverse-derive from it are unaffected.

One consumer needs the shape spelled out: `file_send`'s upload handler resolves
its target from the session map, and its thread-first branch requires a thread
before it will use the linked channel. A flat DM has a channel and no thread, so
it fell through to the owner's DM — a file sent to a different conversation than
the one that asked. The handler now also accepts "channel, no thread" when the
session key IS that channel's key (`slack:<channel_id>`), delivering at the DM's
root. Deliberately not broader: a thread-scoped or dashboard session that merely
knows a channel keeps failing closed to the owner DM rather than broadcasting at
the root of a channel it does not own.

`_route_message` derives the same key for its busy/queue bookkeeping; keyed on
the message ts instead, a second DM would read as not-busy, skip the queue and
block inside `get_or_create` with none of the queued-message feedback. That
derivation (`_dm_single_session_enabled`) additionally requires the turn to
take the messaging-transport path, because only `handle_message_transport`
honours the flat key: with `messaging.use_transport` off, or in a review-mode
channel that `_route_message` deliberately keeps on native for its privacy
gate, the turn runs under `canonical_key(msg_ts)` and the bookkeeping keys the
same way. Both conditions live in that one helper so `!stop`, the queue check
and `message_deleted` cannot disagree.

17. On `complete`: record success, check context usage
18. On error: record failure (circuit breaker trips at 5 consecutive)

22. Post thinking content as 💭 thread reply (if any, and `slack.show_thinking` is true)

### `StatusReactionController`
Phase-aware Slack reaction manager with stall detection. Manages emoji lifecycle per message:
- **Phases**: queued (👀) → thinking (🤔) → coding (👨‍💻) / browsing (🌐) / tool (🔧) → done (🦞) / error (😱). All phase emojis are configurable via `slack.reactions` in `config.json`.
- **Debouncing**: Intermediate phase transitions debounced at 700ms to prevent flickering from rapid tool calls. Terminal states fire immediately.
- **Stall detection**: Soft stall (🥱) at 15s, hard stall (😨) at 45s of no progress. Resets on any ACP event. Paused during tool approval waits.
- **Tool mapping**: `_tool_to_phase(tool_name, tool_kind)` maps tools to phases — prefers `tool_kind` from ACP, falls back to tool name with MCP `__` separator handling.

### LLM-Initiated Commands

The LLM executes cron and spawn operations via bash using the `kirocrew` CLI:
- `kirocrew cron add "name" "message" --every 300` — writes to crons.json, gateway auto-detects via mtime sync
- `kirocrew spawn "task"` — POSTs to dashboard API at localhost:5476, gateway spawns subagent

### `handle_interaction(channel, msg_ts, action_id) -> None`
Routes Block Kit button clicks to pending tool approvals:
- `approve_tool` action → `AcpClient.approve_tool()`, resumes streaming
- `reject_tool` action → `AcpClient.reject_tool()`, stops streaming

### `SlackClientOps` (ABC)
Testable interface for Slack Web API:
- `post_message(channel, text, thread_ts) -> str`
- `post_blocks(channel, blocks, text, thread_ts) -> str`
- `update_message(channel, ts, text)`
- `delete_message(channel, ts)`
- `add_reaction(channel, ts, emoji)`
- `remove_reaction(channel, ts, emoji)`

## Per-Channel Activation Modes

Each channel can have its own activation mode controlling when the bot responds:

| Mode | Behavior |
|------|----------|
| `always` | Process every message from allowed users |
| `mention` | Only respond when @mentioned; continue in thread replies if bot has active session |
| `observe` | Passively record all messages with deep history buffer; respond only when @mentioned (like `mention` but with richer context) |
| `off` | Ignore all messages completely — no history recorded |

**Defaults**: DMs (`D`-prefix) default to `always`. Group channels (`C`/`G`-prefix) default to `mention`.

**Config** (`config.json`):
```json
{
  "slack": {
    "channels": {
      "C0123ONCALL": { "activation": "always", "agent": "ops" },
      "C0456REVIEWS": { "activation": "mention", "agent": "reviewer" },
      "C0789GENERAL": { "activation": "off" }
    },
    "dm_activation": "always"
  }
}
```

**Per-channel agent override**: Each channel can specify an agent that overrides the global default. The agent is passed to `SessionManager.get_or_create()`.

**Thread reply behavior** (mention mode): When the bot is @mentioned in a group channel, it responds in a thread. Subsequent replies in that thread are processed without needing @mention, as long as the bot has an active session for that thread (`SessionManager.has_session(thread_ts)`). Replies in threads where the bot was never mentioned are ignored.

**Owner commands** (`!channel`):
- `!channel` — show current channel activation mode and agent
- `!channel always|mention|observe|off` — set activation mode, persisted to `config.json`
- `!channel agent <name>` — set per-channel agent override
- `!channel agent off` — remove per-channel agent override

**Implementation**: `events.py:_route_message()` checks `orch._cfg.channel_config(channel)` before dispatching. The `@mention` prefix is stripped from text before sending to the LLM. `_persist_channel_config()` in `handler.py` writes to `config.json` atomically via tmp+rename.

## Tracking Channel Monitoring

### Slack Commands

#### Slash Command (`events.py`)

Command name configurable via `slack.command` in config (default: `kirocrew`).

| Command | Handler | Purpose |
|---------|---------|---------|
| `/<command> @user` | `_handle_slash` | Allowlist prompt (Allow/Deny) to owner |
| `/<command> #channel` | `_handle_slash` | Tracking-channel prompt (Track/Ignore) to owner |
| `/<command> sessions` | `_handle_slash` | List active sessions with Slack link status (Block Kit) |
| `/<command> sessions resume <key>` | `_handle_slash` | Resume a session in the current Slack thread |
| `/<command> dashboard` | `_handle_slash` | Generate presigned dashboard link (DM'd to user) |
| `/<command> restart` | `_handle_restart` | Restart the gateway (owner-only; requires an `INVOCATION_ID` / systemd supervisor, else refuses). SEL-audited (approved/denied). Best-effort `save_all_slots_to_history` + `close_all` + `sel.flush` (each bounded by `wait_for`), then `os._exit(1)` so the supervisor respawns |

#### Owner-Only `!` Commands (`handler.py`)

Restricted to `KIROCREW_OWNER_ID`. Processed before keyword commands.

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `!yolo on/off/status` | Toggle global auto-approve for all tool calls |
| `!agent <name>` / `!agent off` | Switch kiro-cli agent globally (all new sessions) |
| `!ta <name>` / `!ta off` | Switch agent for current thread only |
| `!allowlist @user` | Grant/revoke user access |
| `!allowlist #channel` | Add/remove tracking channel |
| `!restart` | Restart the gateway. Bang alias intercepted in `events.py` before the LLM session; delegates to `/kirocrew restart` (`_handle_restart`) so owner-check + supervisor guard stay a single source of truth (`handler.py:_BANG_TO_SLASH`) |

#### Allowed-User `!` Commands (`handler.py`)

Available to any user on the allowlist (not just owner).

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `!dashboard [duration]` | Get a presigned dashboard link (DM'd to you) — **deprecated, use `/kirocrew dashboard`** |
| `!stop` | Force-halt the active agent execution in the current thread. Sends cooperative `session/cancel`; falls back to hard kill if not acked within `agent.soft_stop_budget_secs`. Posts ephemeral Block Kit stopping message with Kill Now button. If no execution is running, replies "Nothing running." |

Native `!stop` and Stop buttons resolve the thread's owning session before
pausing its goal or inspecting pause durability. A goal is paused even between
turns when no provider or handler task exists. Soft, hard and idle acknowledgments
append the shared restart-risk warning while `goal_pause_unsaved` is retained;
ordinary replies without a failed goal pause keep their existing wording.
Inline Stop, stop confirmation and Kill Now use the same warning semantics.
Repeating Stop retries saving the pause without resuming pursuit. A successful
save leaves the goal inactive and removes the warning.

#### Keyword Commands (`handler.py`)

Available to all allowed users.

| Command | Handler | Purpose |
|---------|---------|---------|
| `status` | `handle_message` | Runtime stats summary |
| `spawn <task>` / `bg <task>` | `_handle_spawn` | Run subagent (blocking / async) |
| `spawn list` / `spawn status` | `_handle_spawn` | List active subagents |
| `cron list` | `_handle_cron` | List cron jobs |
| `cron remove <id>` | `_handle_cron` | Remove a cron job |
| `cron pause <id>` | `_handle_cron` | Pause a cron job |
| `cron resume <id>` | `_handle_cron` | Resume a paused cron job |
| `task run <path>` | `_handle_task_run` | Start autonomous task runner |
| `run status` | `_handle_task_run` | Check task runner status |

### Channel Monitoring
- Config: `config.json → slack.tracking_channels` — list of channel IDs to watch
- Event: `member_joined_channel` — fires when a user joins a channel the bot is in
- Requires `channels:read` scope (for public channels) and `groups:read` (for private)
- When a user joins a monitored channel, `prompt_allowlist()` sends Allow/Deny to the owner
- Users already on the allowlist are silently skipped
- If `tracking_channels` is empty, no monitoring occurs
- Tracked channels are capability-probed (`slack/scope_probe.py`, one `conversations.history` call with `limit=1`) after the socket connects at startup and whenever a channel is added to tracking. A `missing_scope`/`channel_not_found` result logs a warning and pushes a dashboard notification — a private channel tracked under an install predating `groups:history` would otherwise fail silently. Deferred (`asyncio.create_task`), best-effort: transient network errors report nothing
- `/<command> @user` still works as a manual trigger (command name configurable via `slack.command` in config, default: `kirocrew`)
- `/<command> #channel` adds a tracking channel via owner approval

## File Attachment Processing

Slack `file_share` messages are processed in `_route_message()` after dedup + auth. Three categories handled in order:

### Voice / Audio (`kiro_crew/transcribe.py`)
- **Mimetypes**: `audio/*`, `video/webm`
- **Flow**: Download via `SlackClientOps.download_file()` → `transcribe.transcribe_audio()` → transcription text prepended as `[Voice memo transcription]...[End of transcription]`
- **Config**: Enabled by default (`stt.enabled = true`). `stt.provider` decides where recognition runs, and the default `local` runs it in this process on a resident whisper.cpp model, so a memo costs one model download (`stt.model`, `base` by default) and nothing after that. A stored retired provider degrades to `local`; there is no binary to put on `PATH`. Availability per provider comes from `transcribe.availability_detail()`, which distinguishes a missing `voice` extra from a platform with no prebuilt recognizer and from a macOS too old for the `apple` provider, because those need different fixes. The pinned `imageio-ffmpeg` wheel decodes the memo's ogg/Opus or webm internally and is bundled in desktop releases; users do not install system FFmpeg. Setup: [configuration](../../../src/kiro_crew/docs/configuration.md) § Speech-to-text.
- **Provider-independent guards**: `transcribe_audio` refuses a sensitive `audio_path` and redacts every provider's output before returning, both before/after dispatch rather than inside a branch, so a provider cannot be added that skips either. See [stt-streaming](stt-streaming.md).
- **Security**: Transcription output run through `redact_credentials()` + `redact_exfiltration_urls()` before injection. Audio file suffix sanitized to alphanumeric only. `_transcribe_audio_files` records a `slack.download_file` and a transcription SEL entry per memo.

### Images (`files.py`)
- **Mimetypes**: `image/png`, `image/jpeg`, `image/gif`, `image/webp`, `image/bmp` (aligned with `AcpClient._send_prompt()` regex)
- **Size limit**: 10 MB (checked from Slack metadata before download and actual bytes after download)
- **Flow**: Download to temp file → inject local path into message text → `_send_prompt()` detects path, base64-encodes, sends as `{"type": "image"}` content block to kiro-cli
- **Temp lifecycle**: Caller (`_route_message`) owns cleanup. Done callback on `handle_message` task cleans up after `_send_prompt()` reads the file. Early-return paths and `create_task` failures also clean up. Queued messages carry their paths in the entry's `image_temp_paths` kwargs; `_dispatch_queued` unlinks after the turn consumes them, and the queue-discard paths — `cancel_queued`, `clear_queue`, `dequeue`'s cancelled-skip, and the `_pending_queue` drops in `_handle_message_deleted` and the `!stop` handler — unlink via `session.unlink_queued_temp_paths()` so entries that never dispatch don't leak files. Known gap: session-teardown paths (restart/remove/destroy/idle sweep) drop `session.queue` without unlinking.
- **Non-inlineable images** (`image/svg+xml`, `image/tiff`, etc.) use the opaque-file path below; they are never injected as ACP image blocks

### Text / Code Files (`files.py`)
- **Mimetypes**: `text/*`, `application/json`, `application/xml`, `application/javascript`
- **Size limit**: 512 KB download cap, 50 KB injection cap (truncated with `[… truncated]` marker)
- **Flow**: Download to temp → read with `errors="replace"` → redact credentials/URLs → inject as `[File: name]\ncontent\n[End of file]`
- **Temp lifecycle**: Always cleaned in `finally` block (text content is read into memory, file not needed after)

### Opaque Files
- **Mimetypes**: `video/*` and every format not handled as inlineable image, text/code, document, or audio; this includes ZIP, binary payloads, SVG, and TIFF
- **Size limit**: 50 MB per file, checked against Slack metadata before download and authoritative bytes after download
- **Flow**: Stream authenticated bytes to a randomized `tempfile.mkstemp()` path → inject the bare local path plus `[Attached file: name]` metadata (original mimetype and actual byte count) → expose the complete file to agent tools
- **Integrity and lifecycle**: Bytes are not transformed. The current or queued turn owns the path and unlinks it after the agent turn completes, or when a queued entry is discarded; early-return and task-creation failures also clean it up
- **Passive by default**: Opaque content is never automatically parsed, extracted, or executed. An inlineable image suffix (`.png`, `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.gif`, `.webp`, `.bmp`) is stripped from the temporary path, because the ACP encoder types a path by suffix alone — otherwise a file named `photo.png` but declared `application/octet-stream` would be inlined as an image without passing content-signature validation. Agent tool access remains subject to normal permissions and hooks
- SEL audit logs successful downloads, pre/post-limit skips, and failures

### Safety Controls
- Type-specific size limits are checked from Slack metadata *before* download and against actual bytes *after* download
- Filetype suffix sanitized to alphanumeric only (prevents path traversal)
- `tempfile.mkstemp()` for all downloads — never uses original Slack filename
- `redact_credentials()` + `redact_exfiltration_urls()` on all text content
- SEL audit on every download, skip, and error

## Streaming UX

- Response streams in real-time via progressive Slack message edits
- Edit throttled to ~1/sec to avoid Slack rate limits (Tier 3: ~50 req/min)
- Cursor indicator (▍) shown during streaming, removed on completion
- Tool calls shown inline as 🔧 _tool name_
- **Thinking/reasoning content** filtered from the main response — accumulated separately and posted as a 💭 thread reply after the main message. Inline `<thinking>` / `</thinking>` tags are also stripped as a safety net. The thread reply is suppressed when `slack.show_thinking` is `false` (default `true`).
- Final message split into multiple posts if over 3900 chars (via `split_message()`)
- **Redaction notice** — when the delivered text (answer or thinking) still carries a `security.CREDENTIAL_REDACTION_TAGS` placeholder or a `security.EXFILTRATION_REDACTION_TAG_PREFIX` (suspicious-URL) placeholder, one `messaging.renderer.redaction_notice` message is posted in the thread after the answer is committed, so the reader knows a command or link they copy will not run as pasted. Worded by kind (credential → re-enter the secret; URL → re-check the link), and byte-identical to the prior `credential_redaction_notice` sentence when only credentials were rewritten. Redaction is NOT relaxed — Slack is an egress path. Counted from the tag in the sent text rather than the redactor's warnings list, which is empty on the streaming path because each chunk was already redacted upstream. **One notice per turn**: answer and thinking share a single tally. Approving a review-mode draft (`interactions.py`) posts the same notice for the same reason, since that publishes to the whole channel. Both posts are best-effort — a failed notice must never turn a delivered answer into a failed turn. The transport-path renderer (`slack/renderer.py`, the default `messaging.use_transport` delivery) posts the same one-per-turn notice: the final display-safe answer body and the posted 💭 reasoning share a single tally, counted with `messaging.renderer.count_redaction_tags` over the form the reader is left with — which can carry placeholders the driver's byte-level stream scan never wrote, because `_display_safe` re-redacts against what Slack renders

## Message Queue (`session.py` + `events.py`)

When a message arrives while a session is actively processing, it's queued instead of spawning a competing session:

- **Session-level queue**: `enqueue()` / `dequeue()` on `SessionManager` using a per-session `deque` + cancelled set
- **Orchestrator-level queue**: `_pending_queue` dict for the startup race (task running but session object not yet created)
- **⏳ reaction**: added to queued messages so the user sees visual feedback
- **FIFO drain**: `_on_done` callback drains both queue levels after each handler completes
- **Cancellation**: `message_deleted` event removes queued messages or marks in-flight messages as cancelled; first `!stop` press clears the queue (via `stop_turn` which calls `clear_queue` unconditionally)
- **`is_cancelled()` check**: handler checks before responding and before the LLM call to suppress responses for deleted messages

## Linked Thread Sync (`handler.py` + `interactions.py`)

Bidirectional message mirroring between dashboard chat sessions and Slack threads:

- **Slack → Dashboard**: `handle_message()` checks `_slack_to_slot` reverse lookup; if linked, routes message to dashboard slot's `_run_chat()` queue
- **Dashboard → Slack**: `_run_chat()` mirrors user messages and agent responses to the linked thread via `start_stream()` / `append_task()` / `stop_stream()`
- **Link to Dashboard button**: `LINK_DASHBOARD_ACTION` in timing footer imports thread history into a new dashboard slot
- **`!link-to-dashboard` command**: same as button but triggered via bang command inside a thread
- **Session resume**: shows Thread/DM choice buttons; `_handle_resume_choice()` with per-session lock for idempotency
- **Fresh-anchor title** (`dashboard/chat_slack.py` slack-link endpoint): the new-thread anchor message title uses the fallback chain slot.title → first-prompt snippet (60 chars, whitespace-collapsed) → `"New session"` — the raw slot key is never user-visible (untitled slots default their title to the key, so the endpoint gates on `display_title != NEW_SESSION_TITLE`)

## Sessions View (`sessions_view.py`)

Shared data-collection and Block Kit rendering for recent sessions, used by three surfaces:

- **`/<command> sessions` slash command** — `_handle_sessions` in `events.py`
- **`sessions` keyword in DMs** — `_handle_sessions_command` in `handler.py`
- **App Home Tab** — 🧵 Sessions section in `_publish_home_tab` (split into "Main chat" and "Autopilot / task runner" sub-lists)

The collector and renderer live in `kiro_crew/slack/sessions_view.py` so both `events.py` and `handler.py` can import them at module top-level without forming a circular import. `sessions_view.py` depends only on `kiro_crew.slack.blocks` and `kiro_crew.security` — it knows nothing about `events` or `handler`, which is what keeps the import graph acyclic.

All three surfaces call `await _collect_recent_sessions_off_loop(sessions, *, limit, kind, include_ended=False)` — the required entry point for async callers, which runs the synchronous collector `_collect_recent_sessions` in a worker thread via `asyncio.to_thread` — to read JSONL files under `~/.kiro/crew/sessions/`, classify them as `dashboard` (main chat slots), `taskrunner` (autopilot/task runner steps), or `other`, and `_build_sessions_blocks(rows, *, for_home_tab=False)` to render them. The sync collector does unbounded-size transcript reads and is worker-thread-only: never call it directly from an `async def`. It pre-scans the directory (kind from the filename stem, rank from each candidate's line 0) and reads only the newest `limit` matching transcripts in full. `include_ended` and the third skip reason are covered under "Ended rows leave the list" below.

**The rank is a session's last HUMAN turn, not its file mtime.** The key is `last_user_at` on the metadata line when the transcript carries one and `st_mtime` when it does not. mtime records the last WRITE, so a cron wake, a monitor loop, a subagent turn, an auto-title refresh or any bulk maintenance pass over the directory reorders the whole list although nobody read those sessions — and a pass that visits them in activity order inverts it outright, because the freshest session is rewritten first and ends up holding the oldest stamp. That is why the rank costs one `readline` per candidate rather than nothing: `stat` cannot answer it. Line 0 is always the metadata line, and a stamp that is missing, malformed, or not on a metadata line falls back to mtime instead of raising. A stamp that cannot be parsed must NOT rank: `transcript_sort_key` reports unparseable through its BUCKET and pairs it with a fallback epoch of `0.0`, so a rank taken from its seconds alone would pin the session to 1970 and bury it below every other row permanently. The file's mtime is a real instant, so a corrupt stamp costs the session its precision, not its place in the list. A decode failure is caught too, at BOTH read sites (`UnicodeDecodeError` is a `ValueError`, so an `except OSError` does not stop it): the rank read now touches line 0 of every candidate, so one transcript of invalid bytes would otherwise raise out through the collector and render "Sessions unavailable" on every surface, on every scan, until someone deleted the file. So is a stamp that PARSES but cannot be resolved: `transcript_sort_key` resolves a naive value with `astimezone()`, which raises at the representable boundary (measured: `year 0 is out of range` for `0001-01-01T00:00:00`, `year 10000` for `9999-12-31T23:59:59`), and the unparseable path never sees those because they parse fine. Both the rank read and the writer's own fold guard the conversion, the writer per stamp so one bad row cannot abort a slot save.

`last_user_at` is written by the dashboard slot save (`chat_persistence._save_slot_to_history`), which already rebuilds the metadata line and already holds the window, so it costs no extra I/O. It is derived from the newest window row carrying `history.HUMAN_TURN_META_KEY`, folded MONOTONICALLY against the value on disk, and deliberately absent from `SLOT_OWNED_META_KEYS`: the window is bounded, so a save whose window has scrolled past the last user row derives nothing, and an owned key's absence would erase a real turn.

**The marker is an ALLOWLIST, and it has to be.** `role == "user"` does not mean a person typed the row: the gateway drives agent turns through the same shape, and `_ChatSlot.enqueue_or_run_prompt` appends `("user", prompt, "msg msg-u")` for an Issue Radar wake — identical in role AND in presentation class to a typed message. A reader that excluded the machine callers it happened to know about would be re-broken by the next one, silently, with background sessions displacing human-active ones again. So the send paths a person actually reaches set the marker (`chat_handlers` ordinary send, `chat_delivery` steer, `channel_slots` channel turn projection) and everything unmarked simply does not count. An app token reaches `api_chat` as well, so the ordinary-send marker is gated on the same empty-`request_app` signal that handler already reads for `user_origin` and `turn_actor` — an app's send is not a human turn and must not advance the stamp. The steer path needs no gate of its own: `api_chat` dispatches a steer only when `request_app` is empty. Under-counting is the safe direction: a session with no marked row keeps ranking by `st_mtime`, exactly as it does today.

The slash command and keyword (which post via `chat.postMessage`) use the shared `blocks.session_task_card` builder. The Home Tab calls with `for_home_tab=True` and uses `section` blocks instead — Slack's `views.publish` API rejects `task_card` with `unsupported type: task_card`. Both paths keep the canonical `mc_session_resume_{key}` action ID handled by `interactions.py:_handle_session_resume`.

The Home Tab requests up to `_HOME_TAB_SESSIONS_PER_KIND = 5` rows per kind so both surfaces stay well under Slack's 100-block view limit. The slash command and keyword each request `slack.sessions_limit` rows, default 10 — the collector's own `_SESSIONS_DEFAULT_LIMIT`. A configured value below 1, or one that is not a number at all, falls back to that default INSIDE the collector: the read loop breaks on `len(rows) >= limit` before it opens a file, so a 0 would render an empty list forever, and an uncomparable value would raise inside each surface's try block and turn a bad number into "Sessions unavailable" plus an error audit. The guard sits at the one chokepoint every surface passes through, so no surface can skip it. The UPPER bound is Slack's own and therefore lives in the Slack module: `chat.postMessage` rejects a payload over 50 blocks, the message layout costs 3 blocks per row less the trailing divider, and 17 rows render exactly 50 (measured against `_build_sessions_blocks`, and pinned by a test that measures it rather than restating the arithmetic). So `_message_surface_limit` clamps the DM keyword and the slash command to `MAX_MESSAGE_SESSION_ROWS`; an over-budget payload is rejected WHOLE, so an unclamped `sessions_limit: 18` would render no list at all, which reads as the feature being broken rather than as one number being too high. The Home Tab is unaffected: it posts through `views.publish`, whose budget is different, and asks for `_HOME_TAB_SESSIONS_PER_KIND` per kind.

**At most `_HOME_TAB_COLLECT_CONCURRENCY` Home Tab collections run at once.** Every `app_home_opened` from an allowed user schedules its own publish with no dedupe, and each collection reads up to `limit` transcripts on the process-wide default executor — shared with history appends, cron store writes and session storage. Ungated, a burst of tab opens fills that executor with multi-MB reads and unrelated `asyncio.to_thread` callers queue behind them. The gate wraps only the collection; the Slack API calls around it stay unserialized. It is created lazily rather than at import, because a module-level `asyncio.Semaphore` binds to whichever loop is current when the module loads and the gateway's loop does not exist yet.

Each surface emits a SEL audit event for the data-access via `sel.log_api_access`:

- Slash command: `slack.sessions_slash_data_access` (caller = Slack user id)
- Keyword: `slack.sessions_data_access` (caller = session key)
- Home Tab: `slack.home_tab_sessions_data_access` (caller = Slack user id)

Sharing the builder also means the `sessions` keyword now displays the same 🟢 active / ⚫ inactive marker as the slash command. Previously the keyword path rendered every card as inactive regardless of session state.

### Ended rows leave the list

`⏹️ End` (`mc_session_end_{key}`, handled by `interactions.py:_handle_session_end`) records a **dismissal** on the row's transcript: `closed: True` plus a `closed_at` epoch on the metadata line, written through `ConversationLog.update_metadata_if` and therefore mtime-preserving. `messaging/sessions_view._row_is_ended` reads that flag back and the collector leaves such rows out unless the caller passes `include_ended=True`.

Three details are load-bearing:

- **The record is written whether or not a session is live.** The soft remove above it only kills a process, and a cluttered list is mostly idle rows — for those the removal branch resolves no key and does nothing, which is why End used to have no observable effect at all.
- **The skipped row frees its slot.** Dismissed rows are skipped inside the read loop the same way empty and unreadable files are, so the list still fills to `limit` with live sessions instead of shrinking. The cost is one read per skipped row: with the *n* highest-ranked rows dismissed, *n* transcripts are read and discarded before the first kept row. Unlike the corrupt-file skips this is an ordinary state, so it is reachable in normal use; it is bounded by the directory, and `with_messages=False` reduces each such read to line 0.
- **`closed_at` is stamped after the teardown**, because consolidation and skill extraction write the transcript on the way out of an End. Nothing in this list compares it (see below); it is written because the dashboard's reader does, and a flag with no instant makes every close there permanent.

A live session outranks the flag, so a resumed conversation is listed immediately. `▶️ Resume` also clears the flag outright (`ConversationLog.clear_closed`), so the row stays listed once that process exits.

This is deliberately **not** the rule `dashboard/channel_slots._close_stands` applies to the same field. That one asks whether a channel conversation outran a closed tab and compares the close against the channel's last write. This one asks whether the user still wants the row, and background housekeeping — consolidation, skill extraction, an auto-title — writes the file without the user doing anything, so any write-based rule would put a dismissed row straight back at the top.

The opt-in is `sessions all` / `sessions ended` (DM keyword) and `/<command> sessions all` (slash). `sessions_view.SESSIONS_INCLUDE_ENDED_ARGS` is the one vocabulary, read both by `sessions_view.sessions_include_ended` and by `handler._is_sessions_keyword` — the matcher has to admit the argument or the message is never routed to the sessions handler at all. Opted-in rows render 🛑 in both the task card and the Home Tab layout so they are distinguishable from merely idle ones. The Home Tab has no argument surface and always uses the default.

## `!compact` Command (`handler.py`)

Triggers in-place ACP `/compact` on the current thread's session:

1. Adds ♻️ reaction, posts "Compacting context…"
2. Streams `/compact` command, waits for `compaction_status` event
3. Falls back to `wait_for_compaction()` (shared `COMPACT_WAIT_TIMEOUT_SECS` budget) if no inline status
4. Posts result (✅/❌) + timing footer
5. On failure: `sessions.discard_conversation(session_key)` — kills the session and drops only the resume sid, so the next message cold-starts. The session-map ENTRY survives, keeping the thread↔session linkage `get_session_for_thread` routes later replies through; `destroy` here would fork the thread into a fresh session with none of its context. Housekeeping never removes a channel identity (see [session](session.md))

## Wedged-Session Recovery (`AcpPromptBusy`)

When kiro-cli reports a prompt is still in flight ("already in progress" — a tool stall, timeout, or message race), `AcpClient` raises `AcpPromptBusy` (`acp/transport_errors.py`, re-exported by `acp/client.py`) with a friendly "I'm still processing a previous request… it clears on its own once the stale turn expires" message. `handle_message` catches it and auto-resets the wedged session via `sessions.reset(session_key)` so the next message cold-starts cleanly, then records the failure (the reset itself is best-effort — a reset failure is logged, not raised). The message deliberately names no command: the auto-reset above is what recovers the session, so the text has nothing to ask the user for (it used to say `!restart`, which is Slack-only, owner-gated, and restarts the gateway rather than the session -- see `common/error-handling.md`).

## OPTIONS Buttons (`format.py`)

LLM responses ending with `[OPTIONS: choice1 | choice2 | choice3]` are rendered as interactive Block Kit checkboxes with a Send button:

1. `extract_options()` parses the `[OPTIONS: ...]` tag from the response text
2. Tag is stripped from the displayed message
3. `build_options_blocks()` creates Block Kit checkboxes (max 10) + primary Send button
4. Checkboxes posted as a follow-up message in the thread
5. Send click → `_handle_options_submit()` → reads checkbox state → posts styled selection → routes combined selection to handler
6. Legacy single-choice buttons still supported via `OPTIONS_ACTION_PREFIX`

Action IDs: `options_checkboxes` (toggle), `options_submit` (send). Checkbox `value` contains the choice text.

Beyond the reply-finalization path in `handler.py`, two other Slack delivery paths also render `[OPTIONS: ...]` as buttons: the dashboard `send_message` MCP tool (`api_send_message` in `dashboard/handlers/messaging.py`) and cron subagent delivery (`_deliver_cron_response` in `gateway.py`). Both call `extract_options()` / `build_options_blocks()`, skip the tag parse when the caller supplies explicit `blocks` (those own their own layout), and wrap the follow-up options post in `try/except` so a failed options post never fails the primary message.

### Inline action values (`action::`)

`action::` is an inline-action **value** protocol inside legacy OPTIONS controls, not a general Block Kit routing protocol. `slack.interactions.dispatch` calls `_handle_options` only for action IDs carrying `OPTIONS_ACTION_PREFIX`, which `slack.format` defines for OPTIONS choices; every other action ID reaches the tool-approval fallback when the interaction supplies a channel and message. `test_unknown_action_id_falls_through_to_tool_approval` locks that fallback.

Two gates run before any handler: `is_allowed_user(user_id)` on the dispatcher, and `channel_inbound_permitted("slack")` for OPTIONS interactions. Both are load-bearing because the action value becomes agent-visible context and a routed turn.

An OPTIONS choice whose `value` starts with `action::` enters the action branch of `_handle_options`. The remainder of `value` is an opaque payload — the handler neither parses nor requires JSON — and the visible label comes from `action["text"]["text"]`, falling back to the selected overflow option's text. `_route_action_to_session` then performs the shared delivery:

1. Redact exfiltration URLs and credentials from the label, then attempt to replace matching elements in the source message with a context label.
2. Post the redacted label as a visible reply in the source thread. A failed post aborts routing, so an agent turn never runs without its visible Slack message; `test_post_message_failure_aborts` locks that ordering.
3. Redact and bound the payload per `_ACTION_PAYLOAD_CAP`, record the Slack access event, and build an `Action button clicked` context entry.
4. Call `slack.handler.handle_message` with the source message's `thread_ts`, the new reply timestamp, the visible label, and `action_context`.

`ContextBuilder.build_message` appends a non-empty `action_context` ahead of the message text, so the payload arrives as context rather than displayed verbatim in the thread (`test_redaction_applied_to_payload`). The source-message update is best-effort: `_route_action_to_session` logs and continues when `update_message` fails, so a successful route does not guarantee the original button was visually replaced.

`_mark_button_clicked` walks every `actions` block; for each block containing the supplied action ID it removes every matching element, inserts a `context` block holding `✓ {label}` immediately before that actions block, and omits the actions block once no elements remain. Blocks without a matching element survive untouched. The identifier match is the load-bearing link between Slack's interaction payload and the rendered message, so an action ID reused across separate actions blocks produces one context label per matching block. `TestMarkButtonClicked` covers replacement, no-match input, and empty-block removal.

`_handle_options` also carries a direct-handler branch for an `action_id` beginning with `action::`: it parses the suffix as a JSON object, obtains a selection through `_extract_selected_value` (which handles `selected_option`, date, time and datetime fields), adds `selected_value`, derives a label from `placeholder.text` plus the selected display text, and routes through `_route_action_to_session`. Malformed JSON or a non-object payload stops the branch without routing. **That branch is not reachable through the Slack dispatcher** — `dispatch` forwards only `OPTIONS_ACTION_PREFIX` action IDs, so an `action::` action ID falls through to `_handle_tool_approval`; `test_extended_element_happy_path`, `test_malformed_json_in_action_id_no_crash` and `test_non_dict_json_in_action_id_no_crash` exercise `_handle_options` directly. An element with an `OPTIONS_ACTION_PREFIX` action ID whose selected value starts with `action::` enters the value branch instead, where that value is the opaque payload and no base JSON object is merged with `selected_value`. Agents must not treat `action::` in an extended element's `action_id` as an available Slack protocol.

`test/test_action_interactions.py` covers the direct action-handler path, payload redaction, audit logging and the block-transforming helpers; `test/test_slack_interactions_coverage.py::TestDispatchPayloadParsing::test_unknown_action_id_falls_through_to_tool_approval` covers the dispatch boundary that excludes arbitrary action IDs.

## Messaging Transport (`messaging.use_transport`)

A channel-neutral dispatch path that replaces the native `handle_message` stream loop with a shared `SlackTransport → TurnDriver → SlackRenderer` pipeline. Gated by `messaging.use_transport` (`MessagingConfig`, default `True` in KiroCrew — the transport abstraction is the canonical path; set `false` to fall back to the legacy native handler — `config/loader.py`). When the flag is on, `events.py:_route_message` routes the message to `handle_message_transport`; when off, nothing in the live gateway path imports the transport (it is purely additive).

- **`SlackTransport`** (`slack/transport.py`): wraps `SlackClientOps` in the neutral `MessagingTransport` contract (dependency direction `slack → messaging`; the `messaging` package never imports Slack). `authorize()` is **owner-only, deny-by-default** — an empty allow-list authorizes nobody, and it SEL-audits **every** rejection (`operation="slack_transport.authorize"`, `outcome="denied"`), including empty/missing `user_id`, so the deny-by-default control is observable.
- **`TurnDriver`** (`messaging/driver.py`): channel-neutral turn loop converting provider `AcpEvent`s into abstract `OutputEvent`s. Approval ladder mirrors the native `APPROVAL_*` contract — `APPROVAL_AUTO` / `APPROVAL_TRUST` (approve all), `APPROVAL_TRUST_READS` (approve `tool_kind == "read"`), `APPROVAL_INTERACTIVE` (deny-by-default unless the injected decider approves). Two injected predicates keep the driver channel-neutral: `auto_approve_tool` (the `spawn_run` / `auto_approve_subagent_spawn` hook predicate) and `auto_approve_session` (per-session Trust). Interactive buttons are rendered only when a decider is present — without one, `_approve()` denies by default so posting buttons would leave dead controls.
- **`SlackRenderer` + `SlackApprovalDecider`** (`slack/renderer.py`): renders abstract output onto a Slack thread and holds the underlying `SlackClientOps` so the dashboard→Slack mirror keeps working. Approval buttons use `mc_tool_approve_` / `mc_tool_trust_` (per-session Trust) / `mc_tool_deny_` action prefixes. `SlackApprovalDecider` maintains a process-global `_REGISTRY` keyed by request id so the module-level interaction handler can `resolve_global()` a click without a direct reference to the per-turn decider; `session_for()` maps a click back to its session for per-session Trust. The decider is **deny-by-default** — it `wait_for`s the button future and returns `False` on timeout.
- **`handle_message_transport`** (`slack/transport_dispatch.py`): agent resolution order is thread override (`!agent`) → per-channel override (`slack.channels.<id>.agent`) → configured default → canonical `"kirocrew"` (`_DEFAULT_KIROCREW_AGENT`). The final fallback matters: without it an empty `agent.default_agent` makes kiro-cli launch its bare built-in default with no `kirocrew-core` server, so `spawn_run` would be missing. Fires the ack reaction + working status before the (cold-start) session acquisition, matching native ordering.
- **`_resolve_approval_mode(orch)`** (`events.py`): the single per-message chokepoint that folds runtime YOLO (owner-toggled `/kirocrew yolo`, TTL-capped `safety_override`) into `APPROVAL_AUTO`, evaluated fresh each message. The transport `TurnDriver` only sees this resolved mode, so both the native and transport paths honor the runtime toggle consistently rather than an unconditional auto-approve. Deny-by-default unless auto-approve is explicitly active.

## Tool Approval Flow

1. ACP sends `permission_request` event during streaming
2. `events.py:_resolve_approval_mode()` evaluates runtime YOLO, then the CLI `--approval` override, then `agent.approval_mode`; only an explicit auto policy yields `APPROVAL_AUTO`, otherwise it yields `APPROVAL_INTERACTIVE`. Native and transport dispatch both use this chokepoint, preventing an operator policy from being silently bypassed.
3. Handler posts Block Kit message with ✅ Approve / 🤝 Trust / 🚀 YOLO / 🚫 Reject buttons
4. `events.py` routes `interactive` Socket Mode event to `interactions.dispatch()`
5. Approval/rejection sent to ACP, streaming resumes or stops
6. Approval button message replaced with outcome text
7. Timeout — steers an in-band approval-timeout notice into the running
   turn (`deny_notice.steer_refusal_notice`: capability-gated, cause
   `approval_timeout`, bounded by `constants.STEER_NOTICE_BOUND_SECS`,
   best-effort), then auto-rejects. The model is told the prompt expired
   unanswered instead of reading kiro-cli generic denial text as a human
   refusal (dashboard precedent: PR #10217). Both Slack paths do this: the
   native `_request_approval` arm (120s) below, and the transport path, where
   `SlackApprovalDecider` records `last_deny_cause = approval_timeout` on
   expiry and the channel-neutral `TurnDriver` steers it before `reject_tool`
   (see the messaging spec's approval ladder).

### Claim-winner invariant (timeout arm ↔ `handle_interaction`)

The pending-approval registry entry is claimed with `pop(key)` BEFORE any
await, on both sides:

- `_request_approval`'s timeout arm pops first; only when it wins the claim
  does it steer and answer the wire (`reject_tool`). A lost claim means a
  click owns the answer; the arm then awaits the click's real outcome via the
  shielded waiter future until it resolves -- no bound, no fabricated
  rejection, nothing on the wire. Every way the click can end resolves that
  future: its approve/reject completes, its write raises (the click
  self-answers the wire), or a backend that stopped reading stdin is torn
  down by the ACP tool-stall watchdog, which raises out of the parked write.
- `handle_interaction` pops at lookup. If its `approve_tool`/`reject_tool`
  raises after claiming, it answers the wire itself (`_reject_orphaned_tool`)
  and resolves the waiter — a timeout arm that already returned can never
  claim again.

Exactly one side ever answers a given `request_id`: a second answer lands in
the ACP client's popped-options cancelled-outcome fallback, which cancels the
whole turn. Every fallback rejection that reaches the wire is recorded in the
SEL audit trail by `_reject_orphaned_tool`. Editors of either function must
preserve this contract.

## Session Management

See `session.py` module spec. Each Slack thread_ts maps to a separate AcpClient instance with idle timeout cleanup.

### Message Queue

Messages arriving while a session is busy are queued with ⏳ reaction and drained FIFO after each handler completes. See [Message Queue](#message-queue-sessionpy--eventspy) above.

### Startup

`start_pool()` creates the background session for cron/heartbeat. Chat sessions cold-start on first message — no warm pool, no MCP reset hack.

## Live configuration

`GatewayOrchestrator` is the process's channel host, so it owns two config
appliers, registered in `_register_config_appliers` on the shared `ConfigWatch`
(`config/live.py`). The `Subscription` objects are kept on `self._config_subs`
because the watcher holds a bound method WEAKLY — an orchestrator a test builds and
discards must not pin itself into the registry. See
[messaging](messaging.md) § Live configuration for the shape every channel shares.

### The hoist is one function per channel

Boot reads each channel's enable flag, credentials and options out of the config
and onto the orchestrator (`_wecom_enabled`, `_telegram_bot_token`, and so on)
before `_start_channel_transports` runs. That work is one
`_hoist_<channel>(cfg, creds)` per channel — `_hoist_wecom`, `_hoist_telegram`,
`_hoist_weixin`, `_hoist_whatsapp`, `_hoist_feishu`, `_hoist_discord`,
`_hoist_webex`, `_hoist_imessage`, `_hoist_teams` — called from `__init__` in
roster order. One function per channel is what makes a reconnect possible at all:
`restart_channel` re-runs exactly one of them against a fresh config instead of
re-deriving every channel's state, so restarting Telegram cannot disturb Discord.

### `restart_channel(channel_type, *, cfg=None)`

The in-process equivalent of a gateway restart for ONE channel, in boot's order:
bounded close of the old handle (`registry.shutdown_tasks`), drop the handle and
its legacy `_<channel>_client` mirror, re-run that channel's hoist against `cfg`
plus a fresh credential read off the loop, re-evaluate the `channels` governance
gate and the readiness badge, then `desc.start(orch)` and store the new handle. A
channel whose new config disables it, leaves it uncredentialed, or is denied by
policy ends CLOSED with its badge explaining why — exactly as it would after a
real restart.

The channel's section on `self._cfg` is replaced with `cfg`'s, because the
`maybe_start_*` factories and the dispatchers they build read their allow-lists
and options from `orch._cfg.<channel>`; without that the restarted transport would
authorize against the boot-time roster. The close, the hoist and the publish of
the new handle run under `_channel_restart_lock`; the connect between them does
not, so a disable's inline close is never queued behind a slow connect, and the
per-channel restart generation (bumped by every close) decides whether the
connected client is published or torn down as superseded. A superseded start
also takes back what its factory already published -- the transport
registration on `DashboardState.channel_transports` and the legacy
`_<channel>_client` mirror -- by identity only (`_forget_superseded_start`),
so a closed transport never keeps answering `get_channel_transport` while a
newer start's registration is left alone.

`_on_channel_config_change` decides when to call it: a channel restarts only when
a changed path names one of its descriptor's `boot_keys`
(`registry.changed_boot_keys`, `messaging/registry.py`). Live fields of the same
section — allow-lists, thresholds, render toggles — are applied by that channel's
own applier without a reconnect, so a change touching only them leaves the socket
alone. Before `_channel_transports_started` the applier raises `ConfigDeferred`
instead of restarting, because the boot loop starts every channel from the hoist
and a restart there would race it; the watcher keeps the paths stale and re-runs
the applier every tick against its CURRENT snapshot, so the first tick after
`start_channels` flips the flag performs the restart the edit asked for. The boot
loop itself never calls the applier: a replay outside `ConfigWatch._apply_one`
would skip the degraded check, and a document with a discarded channel section
retained during the window would then raise straight out of boot instead of
being deferred. That deferral
covers boot keys only, so live fields
edited in the same window — an allow-list revocation between the watcher arming
at dashboard init and the transports starting — are covered differently: the boot
loop re-hoists every bootable channel from the watcher's CURRENT snapshot
(`_adopt_channel_sections_from_watcher`) before the enabled census, so a channel
switched on in the window is started at all, and then re-hoists EACH channel
again (`_adopt_channel_section_from_watcher`, the `before_start` hook of
`registry.start_channels`) synchronously, immediately before that channel's
factory. The second pass exists because channels start one after another and a
connect can take seconds: a revocation that lands while an earlier channel is
connecting has no applier yet for a channel that is not constructed, and a single
read at the top would have left the later channel building from a document the
earlier connects had let go stale. The hook is synchronous and every
`maybe_start_<channel>` constructs its dispatcher — which subscribes to the
watcher — before its first await, so nothing can be dispatched between that read
and the channel's own subscription. A snapshot whose
channel section is degraded leaves the boot copy alone — fail-closed, like every
applier. The whole-config marker alone does not: the snapshot never carries a
torn document's defaults (the watcher keeps the previous values while the file
does not parse), so on a snapshot `*` is the loader's process-long memory of a
repaired tear, and refusing on it would freeze the roster until a restart.

### The Slack applier

Slack is deliberately NOT in the restart loop. Its socket client is owned by
`_connect_slack` under the `channels` governance gate (a deny must DROP the
client), and its tokens live in the credential store rather than `config.json`, so
no `slack.*` write can change the connection. `_on_slack_config_change`
(subscribed on `slack` + `messaging`) reconciles everything else in place:

- `slack.tracking_channels` / `slack.open_channels` → the orchestrator's sets AND
  the `handler` module globals, mutated IN PLACE so the Slack-native modal, which
  edits those same set objects, and a CLI write converge on one set rather than
  two that disagree.
- `slack.channels` / `slack.dm_activation` / `messaging.*` / `trusted_bot_*` /
  `home_tab_sessions_per_kind` / `forward_to_agent_callback` → the shared config
  object every Slack read reaches through `handler.slack_cfg()`, updated
  section-by-section in place so `orch._cfg` and `handler._orch_cfg` cannot
  diverge.
- `slack.reactions` → `handler.refresh_phase_emojis`, which rebuilds `_PHASE_EMOJIS`
  in place; the four read sites call `phase_emojis()` rather than the module global,
  so a reaction rename lands on the next status update.
- `slack.observe_*` → the live `ChannelHistory` caps, and observe-mode registration
  follows the new channel activations.
- `slack.allowed_enterprise_ids` → `enterprise.reload_allowed_team_ids` off the
  loop, which re-runs the VALIDATED `_load_allowed_team_ids` rather than a raw
  read, fails closed on a degraded file, and SEL-audits the change. It runs
  whether or not the workspace has been validated yet: before validation the
  module is default-open, so a reload that skipped that state would leave a
  freshly written allowlist unapplied and every workspace admitted; the
  validated read adds the validated team id only once there is one, and
  `validate_enterprise()` re-runs it when the workspace is known. Never widening
  is the point: this list is what keeps another Grid workspace out.

Fail closed as a whole: when the loader DISCARDED the `slack` section
(`degraded_sections`) nothing under it is applied, the previous sets stay in force,
and the change is logged by PATH only — a `slack` section contains tokens, so no
applier logs a value. A change to `slack.trusted_bot_ids`, `open_channels` or
`tracking_channels` is SEL-audited as its own event, because those sets widen who
may drive a turn; the per-message admission decision is still audited where it is
made.

`slack.command` is the one Slack field marked `restart=True` in
`config/sections.py`: the slash command is registered with Slack's app manifest, so
no in-process apply can change it. No channel CONNECTION field is marked, because
`restart_channel` applies those without a process restart.

## Subagent & Cron Acknowledgment

Subagent completion and cron execution results post to both dashboard (WebSocket) and Slack (DM with ack button). Shared `ack_button()` helper in `interactions.py` handles button replacement:

1. Try `response_url` first (instant, works for 30 min)
2. Fallback: `chat.update` via Slack API (works indefinitely)
3. Section text truncated to 2990 chars (Slack's 3000 char limit)

Bidirectional sync: Slack ack → resolves dashboard approval future + broadcasts `notification_ack` WS event. Dashboard ack → resolves Slack pending future.

### Subagent Slack Replies

When a subagent with a Slack parent session completes, the synthesized LLM response is posted to the owner's DM thread. Long replies are split into multiple messages using `_split_message()` from `handler.py` (3900 chars per chunk, split on newline boundaries), matching the behavior of final chat messages.

A parent session born on any other channel (Telegram, Discord, `unified:` DM buckets, …) delivers the same synthesized reply through the governed cross-surface transport ladder instead (`_deliver_channel_reply` in `gateway.py`): the conversation is resolved via origin link (recorded by Discord's inbound dispatch) → non-Slack mirror link (e.g. a Telegram `/link` binding) → for direct (1:1) sessions only, the stored `"{namespace}:{user_id}"` channel value resolved through `transport.resolve_configured_target`; the target is vetted by `_resolve_channel_target` (SEL-audited, fail-closed, capability-gated on `supports_proactive_send`), then redacted and chunked to the transport's `max_message_chars`. Delivery is best-effort and fail-closed on ambiguity — group/forum sessions without an origin or mirror link, dispatchers that record neither, and denied egress all degrade to the dashboard notification (never a cross-conversation send), and the injected ACP turn still keeps the parent session aware of the result.

## Tool Approval via Slack

### Structured monitor completion adapters

The AutoNudge router keeps its historical `on_fire -> bool`, `cycle_count`,
`fired`, and rearm contracts. A separate runtime-only hook is supplied only when
a structured monitor already has an actionable fingerprint marked in-flight;
legacy loops and ordinary channel messages receive none. `MonitorController`
runs the typed GitHub probe off the event loop, persists the decision and
in-flight claim, and calls the Slack/Discord or dashboard adapter only for
`WAKE_ACTIONABLE`. The adapter receives the already formatted envelope and does
not add the legacy cycle tag. Every non-actionable, retry, and terminal decision
dispatches zero turns.

A Slack message routed into a linked dashboard slot retains channel provenance on
the immediate turn, queue entries, and recovery turns. A monitor directive produced
there persists `channel` as its creation surface even though its storage binding is
the linked chat key, so the link cannot confer dashboard owner credentials on its
provider probes.

Terminal observer notifications are deduplicated for structured monitors within
one gateway process. The retained monitor record also stores whether the dashboard
durably appended its terminal notice. Startup schedules every terminal notice without
that delivery marker as a supervised background task, so notification persistence
cannot delay gateway readiness. The task persists the marker only after the captured
notification append future succeeds, giving the persist-then-notify boundary at-least-once crash
semantics: a crash or append failure can repeat a notice, but cannot suppress the
only notice permanently. A failed notification creation or append releases the
process-local deduplication claim, allowing a later observer event to retry without
requiring a gateway restart. Gated
legacy loops use only their existing `expired` notification; the following `fired`
event must not deliver the same terminal notification again.
Terminal notices identify the watched pull request by its stored target URL,
including channel-bound watches with no dashboard jump link. The completed body,
including the retained target, passes through shared URL and credential redaction
before dashboard notification persistence. The stored stop
reason distinguishes a merged pull request from one ready for review: only a
merge says no action is needed. A `pull_request_closed` blocker states that the
pull request was closed unmerged and offers reopen-or-abandon recovery. Other
known blockers name the credentials, permission, setup, approval, completion,
conversation, or saved-record problem; unknown reasons point to retained details
without guessing that the pull request closed. An unavailable-session notice
directs the operator to start a new watch from an active conversation.

Slack's structured inline nudge runs through `TurnDriver` with the shared,
session-bound directive consumer. Genuine core-MCP `monitor_update`,
`monitor_stop`, and structured `autonudge_stop` tool results therefore mutate
the authoritative Slack monitor before any later raw completion; forged or
sub-agent results retain the driver's fail-closed behavior. Legacy nudges keep
their collector path. Both paths consume `provider_last_turn_usage(client)`
exactly once. That one `TurnUsage` object is fanned out to the existing usage-row
writer and, when the stream observed safe completion evidence, the monitor hook.
ACP-synthesized terminals are excluded. Because stale-stream synthesis reuses
`end_turn`, that reason remains uncharged until ACP events expose provenance;
other safe reasons determine cancellation or failure.
Stream exhaustion and timeout before that event still write the existing usage
row but do not report monitor completion or charge the monitor budget. Callback
or usage-row persistence failure does not change the Slack delivery result. A
structured stream that started reports `DISPATCHED` even if it exhausts or raises
before `EVENT_COMPLETE`; the controller's persisted evidence deadline resolves
the missing callback. Legacy callers retain their historical boolean result.

Discord synthetic nudge injection passes the same hook through
`DiscordDispatcher` to `TurnDriver`. Only a safe `EVENT_COMPLETE` reason reports
completion; a command return, dispatch exception, or renderer
`close()` is not completion evidence. Thus dashboard, Slack, and Discord all
reach the same typed controller callback even though their transport lifecycles
remain different. A queued dashboard turn revalidates its claim after background
admission and before entering `_run_chat`, so a stopped monitor cannot run
prompt-submit hooks; `_run_chat` revalidates again immediately before provider
entry to cover revocation during turn setup. Their pre-completion delivery
contract is also shared:
`DISPATCHED`, `BUSY`, or `UNAVAILABLE`; BUSY is an ordinary durable retry of the
same claimed wake, while only UNAVAILABLE terminates the monitor.

Background task approvals (subagent, cron, task runner, and AutoNudge) post approval buttons to Slack DM via `_interactive_approval()`, racing with dashboard approval:

1. Posts ✅ Approve / 🚫 Reject buttons to owner DM
2. Creates `_PendingApproval` entry for interactive handler
3. Dashboard callback resolves Slack future on dashboard approve
4. Slack button click resolves dashboard future
5. `handle_interaction()` guards against None provider and double-set on futures

### Background Deny-Fast (Unattended Sources)

`_interactive_approval(source)` is used by both interactive UI/slack and
**unattended** background sources. For background sources there is no human
responder, so waiting the interactive approval window on every approval would
stall cron, heartbeat, task-runner, or AutoNudge turns.

- `_BACKGROUND_APPROVAL_SOURCES = {"cron", "heartbeat", "taskrunner", "autonudge", ""}` (module
  constant in `gateway.py`). `is_background = source in _BACKGROUND_APPROVAL_SOURCES`.
- `subagent` is **NOT** background: subagent approvals route to the dashboard
  where the spawning human is present (via the parent slot), so they keep the long
  interactive window.
- When `is_background`, both the Slack `wait_for(pending.future, ...)` and
  `DashboardState.request_approval(..., is_background=True)` use
  `DashboardState._BACKGROUND_APPROVAL_TIMEOUT_SECS` and then **deny** on expiry —
  letting the turn proceed/fail rather than hang. `test/test_dashboard_approval.py::TestBackgroundApprovalDenyFast` pins the bounded background window and the unchanged interactive window.
- The Slack and dashboard windows reference `DashboardState._BACKGROUND_APPROVAL_TIMEOUT_SECS`
  / `DashboardState._APPROVAL_TIMEOUT` as the single source of truth.

### Heartbeat Tool Allowlist (`HEARTBEAT_SAFE_TOOLS`)

Heartbeat sessions run unattended and cannot prompt a human for tool approval. `_is_heartbeat_safe_tool(event_title)` checks whether a tool is safe to auto-approve using a strict **exact-match** against the `HEARTBEAT_SAFE_TOOLS` frozenset — no verb/heuristic fallback (deny-by-default, per security-controls).

**Title normalization** (applied before the set lookup):

1. Strip leading status prefix (`Running: `) via `_HEARTBEAT_STATUS_PREFIXES`.
2. Strip ACP `mcp__<server>__<Tool>` prefix.
3. Strip runtime `@<server>/<Tool>` prefix (kiro-cli titles arrive as `Running: @internal-mcp/ReadInternalWebsites`).

Only the **bare tool name** (e.g. `ReadInternalWebsites`) is tested against the frozenset. Unknown tools are denied and a SEL audit event (`outcome: denied`, `reason: not_in_heartbeat_safe_tools`) is emitted so operators can tune the list. SEL failure on the approve path fails closed (denies the tool).

## Dashboard Token Authentication

### `!dashboard [duration]` Command (deprecated → `/kirocrew dashboard`)

Owner command in `handler.py` that generates a time-limited token URL for dashboard access:

1. Parses optional duration argument via `parse_duration()` — accepts `<N>h` or `<N>m` format (default: `1h`)
2. On invalid duration, replies with usage message
3. Calls `generate_token(user_id, ttl)` to create an HMAC-SHA256 signed token
4. Constructs URL using configured host from `dashboard.url`, or machine hostname for remote access, or `localhost` for local-only
5. Logs via SEL with `operation='slack.dashboard_token'`
6. Posts the URL as an ephemeral-style message in the Slack thread

### Token Auth Middleware

`token_auth_middleware(local_only)` in `token_auth.py` — aiohttp middleware in the explicit middleware chain:

- **Auth required**: on every gated request, loopback included — local-only mode no longer trusts loopback (local port forwarders make remote traffic appear as 127.0.0.1)
- **Bypassed for**: static assets (`/assets/`, `/static/`, `/logo.png`, `/manifest.json`, `/sw.js`, `/icon-*.png`)
- **Token sources**: `?token=` query param (first use) or `mc_token_{port}` cookie (subsequent requests)
- **First query-param use**: binds token to client IP, marks consumed, sets `HttpOnly; SameSite=Strict; Path=/` cookie
- **Cookie use**: validates token + IP binding, allows repeated access
- **Rejection**: returns 403 HTML page with instructions to run `/kirocrew dashboard` in Slack; API paths get JSON error

Token format: `base64url(payload).base64url(HMAC-SHA256-signature)` with per-process secret (`os.urandom(32)`).

### Dashboard URL Config

Single `dashboard.url` field on `KiroCrewConfig` (default: `""`), loaded from `config.json → dashboard.url`.

`is_local_only(dashboard_host, slack_connected)` determines the mode:
- No Slack → local-only (no auth layer)
- Loopback host → local-only
- Non-loopback host → all interfaces, token auth required

```json
{
  "dashboard": {
    "url": "http://my-host.example.com:8080"
  }
}
```
- `"auto"` + Slack + remote host → `"0.0.0.0"`

### Tunnel URL in Slack Links (`slack.use_tunnel_url`)

`SlackConfig.use_tunnel_url` (bool, default `False`) gates whether the AEA
tunnel URL is used when building dashboard links posted to Slack:

- `false` (default) — `send_dashboard_link()` ignores any active tunnel and
  builds links from `dashboard.url` (if set) or the resolved host:port.
  Disabled by default until the tunnel mechanism is scaled for general use.
- `true` — `send_dashboard_link()` prefers `get_tunnel_url()` when a tunnel is
  active, falling back to `dashboard.url`/host:port when the tunnel is down.

The setting is independent of `tunnel.enabled` (which controls whether the
tunnel itself runs). A user may run a tunnel for direct browser access while
keeping Slack links pointed at the local origin.

`--no-tunnel` overrides it. When `use_tunnel_url` is on, the box is
localhost-only and no tunnel is live, `send_dashboard_link()` offers a composed
edition an on-demand provisioning seam (`current_context().tunnel
.ensure_available()`) — a second door out that bypasses `setup_tunnel` entirely,
provisioning straight on the provider without ever constructing a
`TunnelManager`. On a process booted with `--no-tunnel` that seam is not reached
at all (`tunnel.publish_disabled()`), the refusal is SEL-audited as
`tunnel.provision_denied` / `no_tunnel_boot_flag` — the same control as the boot
refusal, so neither door's denials are missing from the trail — and the link is
composed from the local origin instead. The DM also carries a line naming
`--no-tunnel` and the `ssh -L` form: every other route to a local link can still
become reachable (the edition seam re-issues once its tunnel connects), but this
one never will, so without it the requester taps a link that times out every time
with the explanation only in the log. Without that check the flag would be a
promise the product does not keep: an instance that refused to publish at boot
would publish the first time anyone asked for a dashboard link.

**Slack connect is non-fatal** (`GatewayOrchestrator._connect_slack`): the
initial socket-mode `connect()` is wrapped so a network/proxy/timeout failure
(e.g. a stale `HTTPS_PROXY` in the launching shell — slack_sdk's aiohttp client
honours proxy env vars via `trust_env`) logs a warning and the gateway
continues in **dashboard-only mode** instead of crashing the whole process.
Only ordinary `Exception`s are swallowed; `CancelledError` (BaseException)
still propagates so real task cancellation is not masked. There is no
background retry of the initial connect — Slack DM stays disabled until the
next gateway restart. The "connected to Slack" banner prints only after a
confirmed connect.

## Security

- Owner-locked via `KIROCREW_OWNER_ID` in `.env` (supports W/U prefix cross-matching)
- **Enterprise Grid validation** (`slack/enterprise.py`): Two-layer defence against data exfiltration to personal/external Slack workspaces:
  1. **Startup gate**: `validate_enterprise()` calls `auth.test` with the bot token, verifies `enterprise_id` matches the configured production (`E0123ABC456`) or sandbox (`E0456DEF789`) grid. Caches `team_id` and `enterprise_id` in memory. Clears cache before each validation attempt so re-validation failures are fail-closed. Gateway refuses to connect if validation fails.
  2. **Per-message gate**: `check_message_origin()` compares each incoming event's `team` field against the cached `team_id`. Catches `.env` hot-swap while running. Zero-cost in-memory string comparison, no API call. Deny-by-default: empty `team` field is rejected.
  - Configurable extra IDs via `slack.allowed_enterprise_ids` in config.json (for additional subsidiary grids)
  - **One list, two id spaces — Enterprise Grid needs BOTH kinds in it.** `auth.test` returns an org-level `enterprise_id` (`E…`) *and* the install workspace's `team_id` (`T…`), while each inbound event carries the child workspace `team_id` it was sent in. The startup gate checks `enterprise_id or team_id`, so on Grid the **org id** must be listed or validation refuses and Slack is disabled; the per-message gate only ever compares the event's **workspace id**, which an `E…` entry can never equal, so **every child workspace id** must be listed or its messages are denied. Supplying either kind alone fails, and the two failures look nothing alike: workspace-ids-only refuses loudly at boot, while org-id-only passes validation (`Enterprise validation OK`) and then denies every DM — armed, because any entry leaves default-open, with nothing inbound able to match. `_diagnose_allowlist_id_spaces()` warns at load time for the org-id-only case (SEL `error=allowlist_admits_no_inbound_workspace`), and the startup refusal names the missing org id for the other, so neither state is silent or points at the wrong remedy. Both are DIAGNOSTIC: admission is unchanged, because treating an `E…` entry as org-wide admission would widen the allowlist this gate exists to keep narrow.
  - **Corrupt-config fail-closed**: `KiroCrewConfig.load()` degrades a torn/corrupt `config.json` (or `config.local.json` overlay) to a defaults object rather than raising, so `slack.allowed_enterprise_ids` would come back empty. `_load_allowed_team_ids()` positively detects that degraded read (a config file that exists on disk but does not parse) and fails CLOSED -- the allowlist stays enforced and admits NO origin (not even the just-validated workspace, which would answer the allowlist's own question) so startup is refused, and the degradation is SEL-audited (`operation=slack.allowed_team_ids_load`, `error=config_load_degraded_fail_closed`) -- instead of silently reverting to default-open. A genuinely unconfigured allowlist (no config file, or a clean file listing none) stays default-open.
  - **One reader owns the allowlist**: the admitted set comes only from that validated read of `slack.allowed_enterprise_ids`. Caller-supplied `extra_ids` -- the caller's own earlier `KiroCrewConfig.load()` snapshot of the same key -- does not contribute to it. The validated read is never older than the snapshot, so ids the snapshot holds and the read does not are ids the operator REMOVED, and unioning them would undo the removal. Consequence in both directions: removing one id takes effect at validation, and emptying the list returns to default-open, matching what a restart does. `extra_ids` does not contribute on the `auth.test`-failure path either, so the validated read is the sole source on every path: that path decides fail-open vs fail-closed by asking whether a restriction is configured, and counting an older snapshot there would manufacture a restriction the file does not list. An UNREADABLE config still refuses there -- a config that cannot be honoured is not one that honestly lists no restriction -- and a configured allowlist still fails closed.
  - All validation outcomes logged to SEL (`operation=slack.enterprise_validation`)
  - `kirocrew doctor` includes workspace validation check
- **Deny-by-default**: if `KIROCREW_OWNER_ID` is unset or empty, Slack is disabled entirely at startup (`init_socket_mode` refuses to connect). The access check in `_route_message` also rejects all messages when owner ID is missing, as a secondary guard.
- **Interactive payload access check**: `interactions.dispatch()` uses deny-by-default — rejects unless the clicking user is positively confirmed as allowed. Non-allowed users receive an ephemeral message ("⛔ You are not authorized to use these buttons.") and the original buttons remain intact for the owner to click later.
- Dedup cache (`SeenCache`) prevents processing duplicate Slack events
- Bot self-message filtering via `bot_id` check
- **Trusted bot IDs** (`slack.trusted_bot_ids` in config): allows specific bot IDs to bypass the blanket `bot_id` filter, enabling multi-node mesh communication. Empty list = all bot messages dropped (default), and a bot id NOT in the list is denied exactly as with no list (fail-closed, `error=untrusted_bot`). Admission requires a positive `bot_id` match against the allowlist; the match sets `from_trusted_bot`, which lets the `bot_id` stand in as `sender_id` and grants access equivalent to an allowed user — authorization is explicit via the `trusted_bot_ids` config allowlist, not the `slack.allowed_users` list. All trusted-bot permission decisions emit SEL audit events (allowed decisions carry `resources="trusted_bot"` so the decision basis is traceable). Echo protection: error replies to trusted-bot messages are suppressed on both dispatch routes — the native path (`from_trusted_bot` in `handle_message`) and the default transport path (`from_trusted_bot` in `handle_message_transport`, threaded through the immediate call, both session queues, and `_dispatch_queued`; the error message is suppressed but the thread status is still cleared). Successful-reply loops are bounded by the **per-thread turn cap** (`slack.trusted_bot_turn_limit`, default 5, minimum 1): a thread that has run that many consecutive trusted-bot turns admits no more (`error=trusted_bot_turn_limit_reached`) until an allowed human posts in it, which resets the count — without the cap, two mutually trusted gateways would admit each other's replies as fresh turns indefinitely. Only a message that actually dispatches a turn moves the count (Slack retries, message/app_mention duplicate pairs, and activation-dropped messages do not). Review-mode channels deny trusted bots outright (`error=trusted_bot_denied_in_review_channel`): the review draft flow delivers via an ephemeral to the sender, which requires a human user id. The gateway's own bot id (cached from the startup `auth.test` that enterprise validation already performs) is never trusted even when listed (`error=own_bot_id_never_trusted`) — otherwise every reply would re-enter the handler as fresh input, a self-reply loop; when `auth.test` was unavailable the self identity is unverified and the admission FAILS CLOSED, trusting nobody (`error=trusted_bot_requires_verified_self_id`) — the same posture enterprise validation takes for a configured allowlist with unverifiable workspace identity. The (unwired) `SlackTransport.receive` inbound path and this gate call ONE owner of the admission rule, `slack.enterprise.trusted_bot_admission` — positive allow-list match, own-bot exclusion, fail-closed unverified self id, audited decisions, trust before the subtype filter — so the two Slack inbound paths cannot drift about which peer bots are admissible. What each site still owns is the READ TIMING of the allow-list it passes in: this gate passes the live config, so an operator's edit takes effect on the next event, while the transport freezes a constructor snapshot to match its `allowed_users` pattern.
