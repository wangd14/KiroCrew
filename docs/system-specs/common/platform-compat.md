# Cross-platform: route POSIX calls through `platform_compat`

Kiro Crew runs on macOS, Linux (x86_64 and ARM), and Windows (native). `fcntl`,
`termios`, `resource` and `pty` do not exist on Windows, and
**`os.kill(pid, 0)` TERMINATES the target there**: it is not a liveness probe.

`kiro_crew.platform_compat` owns one helper per POSIX call the codebase needs. Reach
for the helper, not the stdlib call, even in code you believe only runs on POSIX — the
import alone is enough to break a Windows install, and the failure lands at import time
in a module a Windows user cannot avoid.

This is the contract. The Windows install and runtime story a user follows is
[windows-install.md](../../guides/windows-install.md).

## Why a table rather than a rule

Half of these are not "the POSIX call is missing on Windows". They are cases where the
stdlib call **exists and answers wrongly**: it silently no-ops, it returns a
high-water mark where a live reading was wanted, its unit differs per platform, or it
follows a link planted at the name. A rule of the form "guard it with `IS_POSIX`"
produces exactly those silent failures, which is why the helper is named per call.

## The helper for each call

| Need | Use (`platform_compat`) | NOT |
|------|--------------------------|-----|
| Tail a rotating log | `open_log_file_for_tail(path)` returns a binary read descriptor (caller closes); Windows permits read/write/delete sharing so the writer can rename during a read. Only for log readers, never security pinning. | plain `open` held while a Windows writer rolls over |
| File lock | `file_lock(fd, exclusive=)` / `acquire_lock`+`release_lock` / `try_acquire_lock`. Windows takes a byte-range lock on byte 0 (`msvcrt.locking`), acquired by spinning on the non-blocking code because msvcrt's own blocking code gives up with `EDEADLOCK`; the spin is bounded so a stuck holder is reported rather than waited on forever, and both platforms fail CLOSED past the ceiling. That range lock is MANDATORY, unlike POSIX advisory `flock`: while it is held, byte 0 is unreadable and unwritable through every other descriptor, including another descriptor of the holding process. So a lock descriptor is never written through — not even to place a byte for the range to cover, which a sibling's acquire turns into `EACCES` on the writer. A byte-range lock covers byte 0 of a ZERO-LENGTH file and still excludes every other descriptor and process, so a lock sidecar stays empty | `fcntl.flock`; writing a byte through a lock descriptor to make its range "lockable" |
| Liveness probe | `pid_exists(pid)` / `pid_liveness(pid)` | `os.kill(pid, 0)` (kills on Windows!) |
| Kill a process | `kill_pid(pid, sig)` | `os.kill(pid, sig)` |
| Kill a tree | `kill_process_tree(pid, sig)` | `os.killpg(os.getpgid(pid), sig)` |
| Kill a group the caller CAPTURED | `kill_process_group(pgid, sig)` — group-addressed; the id must have been read while the group's leader was alive and identity-checked (`process_identity.isolated_group_of`), the broadcast/self guard refuses with `ValueError` instead of degrading to a pid, POSIX only | `os.getpgid(pid)` at signal time (a recycled pid names a stranger's group) |
| Parent PID | `get_ppid(pid)` | `/proc` read / libproc |
| Session process identity | `get_process_start_id(pid)`; Windows uses query-only creation FILETIME, Linux start ticks, macOS libproc microseconds with a `sysctl KERN_PROC_PID` fallback for a zombie (libproc refuses one; the kernel's zombie list still carries the same `p_start` instant) | caller-supplied PID or a bare PID without its creation identity |
| Listener-owner ancestry | `process_descendant_identities(pid, candidate_pids=...)` returns each PID, PPID, start token, and its `ATOMIC` or `LSTART` source. Rechecks use `process_start_id_for_source` and never fall across encodings; an unavailable capture source is inconclusive. Before the POSIX fallback filters stable rows, it derives the root subtree from the first `ps` snapshot and requires every one of those rows to be unchanged in the second; any missing, reparented, or re-identified subtree row returns `None`, while unrelated rows may churn. The shared tri-state process-start comparator accepts strictly later, excludes strictly earlier, and treats equal coarse or unparseable order as inconclusive. A discovered parent must keep the same identity across its child-list read. Every child named by that read must still have a readable identity and the same parent. A changed parent, vanished child, or reparented child makes the whole walk return `None` rather than a completed partial result. On Windows each candidate-to-root chain must also keep the same PIDs, creation IDs, and edges across two Toolhelp snapshots, while unrelated siblings may churn. `created_after` remains a numeric-only Boolean wrapper over that core for its pod and harness callers | requiring the whole process tree to remain unchanged, accepting a bare descendant PID, filtering unstable root-subtree rows into a completed partial result, comparing an `lstart` capture with atomic ticks or microtime, treating same-second fallback timestamps or a changed/vanished task as foreign, or maintaining a second comparison implementation |
| macOS zombie state | `darwin_pid_is_zombie(pid)` (`True` / `False` / `None` unreadable; a pid the kernel does not list reads `True`); `darwin_kinfo_proc(pid)` for the record with its start id; `darwin_pgroup_members(pgid)` lists a process group with each member's zombie flag | `pid_exists` as an exit oracle (a zombie is alive to it); `pgroup_exists` as an empty-group oracle (a retained zombie leader keeps it true); `proc_pidinfo` on a zombie |
| Zombie state, cross-platform | `pid_is_zombie(pid)` (`True` / `False` / `None`): Linux reads the state field of `/proc/<pid>/stat` after the last `)` (`Z`, or `X` for a process being torn down), macOS defers to `darwin_pid_is_zombie`, Windows and an unreadable pid answer `None` — the "is it still RUNNING" question a survivor check asks beside `pid_exists` (a signalled child sits in the zombie state until it is collected); never signals | `pid_exists` alone as a running-vs-exited oracle; reading the state before the first `)` (a comm may contain spaces and parentheses); treating `None` as "not a zombie" |
| Linux execution-boundary equality | `process_namespaces_match(pid, reference_pid)`; compares user and mount namespace inodes with incarnation checks; `None` on unreadable or unsupported platforms | absent current ancestry as proof that a process is unconfined |
| macOS inherited sandbox state | `process_is_sandboxed(pid)`; read-only Seatbelt query with an incarnation check; `None` on errors or other platforms | treating an unavailable query as unsandboxed |
| macOS sandbox file-read permission | `process_can_read_under_sandbox(pid, trusted_absolute_path)`; queries Seatbelt without opening the file, checks incarnation before and after, and returns `None` on unknown | treating all sandboxed processes as either private or Global; a query error as a grant |
| Loopback TCP caller PID | `get_tcp_peer_pid(sockname[:2], peername[:2])`; unique ESTABLISHED reverse IPv4/IPv6 tuple, failure is unknown. Linux maps the kernel socket inode to process FDs; macOS uses trusted system lsof; Windows uses the owner-PID table. Offload this probe; prefer Unix peer credentials where available. | HTTP headers, a listener's PID, or matching only a port |
| Match process cmdline | `process_matches(pid, needles)` | `/proc/<pid>/cmdline` / `ps` |
| Read Linux process name | `linux_process_name(pid)`; exact kernel `comm`, `None` off Linux or on an unreadable/empty value. Fixture tests may pass `proc_root=`. | reading `/proc/<pid>/comm` outside the compatibility layer |
| Compare process cgroups | `process_cgroups_match(pid, reference_pid)`; compares stable unified cgroup v2 membership and returns `None` off Linux, on cgroup v1, on unreadable/changing membership, or when identity is otherwise inconclusive. Fixture tests may pass `proc_root=`. | comparing one `/proc/<pid>/cgroup` read without stability rechecks |
| Process start time (PID-reuse guard) | `process_start_time(pid)` | `/proc/<pid>/stat` / `ps -o lstart=` (both answer `None` on Windows, so the guard silently never confirms) |
| Is this pid a PROCESS rather than a thread | `is_thread_group_leader(pid)` for one pid; `live_thread_group_leaders()` once for a whole sweep | `pid_exists(pid)` alone (Linux numbers threads from the pid space and POSIX permits signalling a tid, so a pid recycled as a THREAD of an unrelated process reads as alive forever). Both answer `None`, never `False`, when unknowable — treat `None` as "retain", never as licence to act |
| Signals | `platform_compat.SIGKILL` / `SIGTERM` | `signal.SIGKILL` (undefined on Windows) |
| Spawn isolation | `start_new_session=IS_POSIX` + `creationflags=CREATE_NEW_PROCESS_GROUP` | bare `start_new_session=True` |
| Wait on a subprocess PIPE with a deadline | a daemon reader thread feeding a `queue.Queue`, consumed with a bounded `get` (`testing/harness.py`'s `_StdoutPump`) | `selectors.DefaultSelector()` on the pipe (select()-based on Windows, which accepts SOCKETS only, so registering a pipe RAISES there) |
| Re-enter an edition's stable gateway launcher | `reexec_launcher(launcher, args)` after `gateway_restart.resolve_restart_launcher()` validates it; keeps the dispatch pathname, original arguments and UTF-8 environment | resolving the symlink basename away, passing Python `-m` flags to a launcher, or evaluating a shell command |
| Re-exec the current Python module | `reexec_python_module(module, args)` | `os.execv(sys.executable, [sys.executable, ...])` (breaks when the Windows interpreter path contains spaces) |
| Launch a Kiro Crew-owned Python child | `isolated_python_argv(*args, executable=...)`; it adds `-s` for the bundle and parents whose user site is already unavailable, unless the option prefix carries `-s` or stronger `-I` | a raw `[sys.executable, ...]`, or an ad hoc `PYTHONNOUSERSITE` env that another spawn path can omit |
| Replace the current process with another program (a supervised service body) | spawn a child, record its pid + `process_start_time`, and `wait()` on it under `IS_WINDOWS` (see `pod.windows.supervise_gateway`) | `os.execve` (on Windows this SPAWNS and terminates the caller, so the pid changes and the service manager sees the unit exit while the real program keeps running orphaned) |
| Open an exact Windows process object for later tree discovery/termination | `open_process_termination_handle(pid, expected_token)` validates the opened handle's creation identity before returning it (caller closes with `close_process_handle`); combine with `descendant_termination_handles` so the anchored root and each retained child receive a final post-exit snapshot | opening by PID and checking the token beforehand (PID reuse can occur between those operations) |
| Race-free Job object assignment | `creationflags \|= CREATE_SUSPENDED`, then `apply_job_limits`, then `resume_process_main_thread` | assigning a job to an already-running child (descendants it already spawned escape) |
| Fork-bomb / memory ceiling on a spawned tree | `sandbox.apply_windows_resource_ceiling(pid)` after the spawn, alongside `cgroup_scope_argv` | `cgroup_scope_argv` alone (a no-op on Windows, so no ceiling at all) |
| Size an `ActiveProcessLimit` as "this Python child and nothing else" | `1 + python_launcher_hops()` (`1` when `sys.executable` is a venv's `Scripts\python.exe`, the redirector that `CreateProcess`-es the base interpreter as its own child and stays alive as its parent; `0` for an interpreter and on POSIX); kill a timed-out child as a TREE (`kill_process_tree`) so the interpreter goes with its redirector | a literal `max_procs=1` (refuses the redirector's spawn: `Unable to create process using ...`, exit 101, so the child never runs from a venv); `proc.kill()` on the redirector alone |
| File mode | `chmod_safe(path, mode)` / `fchmod_safe(fd, mode)` | `os.chmod` / `os.fchmod` (no `os.fchmod` on Windows) |
| Owner-only secret (fail-loud) | `restrict_to_owner(path)` | `os.chmod(path, 0o600)` under `if IS_POSIX` (silent no-op leaves secrets world-readable) |
| Owner-only secret directory (fail-loud, inheritable) | `restrict_dir_to_owner(path)`; `make_owner_only_dir(path)` to also create it (its tighten step is best-effort) | `restrict_to_owner(path)` on a directory (its Windows grants carry no `(OI)(CI)`, so files created inside land on the default DACL, not owner-only; its `0o600` also drops the execute bit a directory needs) |
| Is a path on a NETWORK volume | `path_volume_is_remote(path)` (Windows: the volume ROOT's drive type through `windows_acl.volume_is_remote`, so a UNC path and a mapped drive both read remote, at no SMB round trip; `None` off Windows, where the caller has a mount table — `taskq.store.detect_network_filesystem` is the caller) | reading a failed query, `DRIVE_UNKNOWN` or a non-Windows host as "local" (`windows_acl.volume_is_local` collapses unknown onto `False` on purpose; that is the trust answer, not this one) |
| Confirm a Linux readonly filesystem | `is_readonly_filesystem(path)`; false for other platforms or probe failure. Used to reject a private-runtime diagnostic marker planted in the writable host home. | `os.statvfs` in a cross-platform consumer, or readonly file mode alone |
| Directory link | `symlink_or_junction(target, link)` | `os.symlink` (`WinError 1314` without elevation) |
| Detect/remove a dir link | `is_link_or_junction(path)` / `unlink_link_or_junction(path)` | `path.is_symlink()` (misses a Windows junction) |
| Compare a resolved path against an unresolved one | `strip_extended_length_prefix(path)` on BOTH sides before comparing | comparing the two spellings as `Path.resolve` returns them (on Windows `ntpath.realpath` keeps the extended-length prefix when its prefix-strip re-check races a concurrent swap of the same file, so a prefixed child against an unprefixed parent reads as a path escape; the fold is LEXICAL and must not re-resolve, which would bless the redirect the caller is testing for) |
| Hold a directory in place while a child writes into it by path | `pin_directory(path)` (then `os.close`) | `os.open(dir, O_RDONLY)` (EACCES on Windows, and even where it opens it follows a link planted at the name) |
| Act on the ENTRIES of a directory you inspected (screen-then-remove, screen-then-descend) | `pinned_directory(path)` yielding `PinnedDirectory` (`names` / `is_link` / `is_dir` / `unlink` / `rmdir` / `child` / `child_if_real_dir` / `read_text`); a parent stays pinned while its child is in use, so a chain of them pins the whole path, and `child` refuses past `PINNED_TREE_MAX_DEPTH` (64) levels with `ENAMETOOLONG` so a planted chain cannot spend another frame or descriptor. **Descend with `child_if_real_dir`**, which answers None when what is at the name is no longer a real directory and RE-RAISES for one that is: it holds the errno-agnostic dispatch (a refused `O_DIRECTORY \| O_NOFOLLOW` open is ENOTDIR on some kernels, ELOOP on others, `NotADirectoryError` on Windows) in one place, and its callers supply the differing action — two remove the entry, one deliberately leaves it. Its re-raise is also how the depth refusal reaches a caller, so an over-deep tree fails the operation instead of being unlinked as though it were a link | screening a NAME and then operating on that name -- every stdlib walker re-resolves it in between, and `os.walk`'s own descent re-check is `os.path.islink`, which is False for a junction, while `rglob` descends one unconditionally. The two platforms need OPPOSITE routes, which is why this is a helper rather than an `IS_POSIX` branch per call site: `dir_fd`-relative calls on POSIX, where the pin does NOT block a rename, and by-path calls on Windows, where there are no `dir_fd` operations at all and the pin is what holds the path still. Also: hand-spelling the refused-open fallback at a call site, where a fourth copy gets the errno dispatch subtly wrong |
| READ a file you judged in the same traversal (screen-then-read) | `PinnedDirectory.read_text(name, max_bytes=…)` -- the open itself refuses a link at the name, the descriptor's own `fstat` rejects a non-regular entry, a hardlink and anything over `max_bytes`, and the open is non-blocking so a FIFO cannot stall the read. The size is asked of the OPEN DESCRIPTOR, not of a stat taken before it, and the read itself is bounded too, so a file that grows between the two stops at the cap. The layers under it are private on purpose: reaching for a raw descriptor would be operating outside the pin | screening a name and then reading that name -- the entry is re-resolved in between, and the screen only refuses a link that was PRESENT at check time, so a flip-flop serves a file of the adversary's choosing. Also: a pre-open `stat` for the size, which measures a different file than the one the read then opens |
| ENUMERATE a directory whose contents an agent writes | `PinnedDirectory.names_bounded(limit)`, which answers None when the directory holds more than *limit* entries | `names()` (or `sorted(os.listdir(...))`) on such a tree: the eager list IS the exhaustion, allocated in full before any budget the caller applies afterwards could refuse it. Returning the first *limit* names instead of None would be worse than either -- the caller acts on a partial directory while believing it saw all of it |
| Open one component of a path you are still walking, whatever it turns out to be | `open_entry_no_follow(path)`, then classify the DESCRIPTOR with `is_reparse_point_fd(fd)` (then `os.close`); it takes the reparse ATTRIBUTE off `os.fstat` and the deciding reparse TAG off the handle, because CPython fills `st_reparse_tag` only on the path-based `stat`/`lstat` route and reports zero on a descriptor | `pin_directory` or `open_file_no_reparse` (each refuses what it is not looking for, and a walk needs "a link sits here, read its target", "this is a file, the path ends" and "carry on" kept apart -- both answer `NotADirectoryError` for the first two); `is_link_or_junction(path)` after the open (a second look by name, at a name that can change between the two); testing `os.fstat`'s bare `FILE_ATTRIBUTE_REPARSE_POINT` (Windows sets it on kinds that redirect nothing -- a cloud placeholder, a WOF- or dedup-backed file -- so a walk keyed on the bit refuses ordinary local paths); or attribute-only desired access on a component a resolution passes THROUGH (see the sharing rule under `platform_log_append` below -- it pins nothing, so the walk would hold that component still against nothing; `hold=False` is for the LAST component alone, which a resolution ends at, and which must therefore be classified but need not be pinned) |
| Process RSS (live) / peak RSS / CPU | `proc_rss_bytes()` / `proc_peak_rss_bytes()` / `proc_cpu_seconds()` | `resource.getrusage` (`ru_maxrss` is a high-water mark, never a live reading, and its unit is KiB on Linux but bytes on macOS). The peak on Linux is NOT `ru_maxrss`: `execve` seeds it with the pre-exec image's peak, so a gateway started from a large parent would report that parent's number for life; Linux reads its own `/proc/self/status` `VmHWM` instead, monotonic across reads (the kernel folds live RSS into `hiwater_rss` lazily, so raw consecutive readings can dip a few hundred KiB), and an unreadable `/proc` is the documented 0, never the inherited figure. `pdf_extract_child` carries the same `VmHWM` parser rather than importing this module (its imports stay minimal under a capped address space) |
| A deadline that survives a host suspend and needs no thread or GIL | `arm_process_alarm(seconds)` (`0` cancels), guarded by `process_alarm_available()`: the kernel's `setitimer(ITIMER_REAL)`, which Linux runs on `CLOCK_MONOTONIC` and macOS on the absolute mach timebase, so a pending deadline keeps its remaining time across a sleep instead of firing on resume; pair it with `faulthandler.register(SIGALRM, ...)` for a GIL-free stack dump, released with `faulthandler.unregister` and registered afresh on every arm (a repeat `register` reinstalls nothing while faulthandler believes it still holds the signal, so a temporary owner that handed `SIGALRM` back with `SIG_DFL` would otherwise leave the next alarm to end the process without a dump). `False` on Windows, which has no such timer — the caller falls back to a mechanism it names for that platform (the loop watchdog uses faulthandler's timer thread there). The timer belongs to the process image that armed it and to no successor: `execve` preserves `ITIMER_REAL` while it resets a caught `SIGALRM` to its default disposition, so `reexec_launcher` / `reexec_python_module` cancel it immediately before `os.execv`, and the gateway entrypoint clears any deadline that still arrived (`loop_watchdog.disarm_inherited_alarm`, only while `SIGALRM` is at its default disposition) | `faulthandler.dump_traceback_later` as a standing deadline (its wait is `CLOCK_REALTIME`-based on every macOS build and on any Linux build without `sem_clockwait`, so a suspend longer than the budget fires it on resume); `signal.setitimer` / `signal.SIGALRM` reached directly (neither exists on Windows); a bare repeat `faulthandler.register` as a way to re-install the handler; an `os.execv` outside the two reexec seams while a deadline is pending (the successor is ended by a signal it never armed) |
| Now on the suspend-inclusive clock (dating a process start, or measuring a sleep) | `boottime_now()`: `CLOCK_BOOTTIME` on Linux (it counts time the host spent suspended, as `/proc/uptime` and the `starttime` field of `/proc/<pid>/stat` do), `time.time()` on macOS (the clock libproc dates process starts on; it can step, so the liveness oracle pairs it with `acp/liveness.steady_now`), `None` where neither exists — a caller reads `None` as "cannot say", never as a time. The liveness oracle stamps a tool dispatch on it, and the loop watchdog compares its advance against `time.monotonic()` across one poll to name a resume | `time.monotonic()` against a `/proc` process age (`CLOCK_MONOTONIC` stands still through a suspend, so a boot-clock age minus a monotonic stamp places a live child before its own dispatch); `time.clock_gettime(time.CLOCK_BOOTTIME)` outside the compatibility layer (absent on macOS and Windows); importing the reader from `kiro_crew.acp` in application code (the agent-SDK boundary gate refuses the edge) |
| Available host memory | `host_available_mib()` (0 = unknown, never 0 = no memory) | `/proc/meminfo` directly (Linux-only, so the bound built on it silently vanishes on macOS and Windows) |
| FD soft limit | `raise_nofile_soft_limit(n)` | `resource.setrlimit` |
| Port to PID | `find_listening_pids(port)` / `listening_pid_tool_available()`; `find_port_listeners(port)` when ownership must be scoped to the local address actually probed; `probe_port_listeners(port)` when completed-empty must be distinguished from timeout or execution failure; `process_owns_loopback_listener(pid, port)` for per-process ownership through Linux procfs, PID-scoped `lsof`, or Windows `GetExtendedTcpTable` owner-PID tables | `lsof` or `netstat` directly |
| Spawn a system tool (`ps`, `lsof`, `netstat`, `taskkill`) | `trusted_system_bin(name)`, treating `None` as "unavailable" | a bare argv name (resolved through a `PATH` that can lead with same-uid-writable dirs) |
| Decide whether an executable's PATH can be trusted (ownership, mode bits, writability by some account) | `traversed_components(path)` for the ENUMERATION, then the site's own predicate over every entry. It resolves the path COMPONENT BY COMPONENT, expanding each symlink it meets, and returns every directory the walk actually reads — the original spelling's side, each hop's side and the target's side — plus the final target, root-first, each once; `None` on `OSError` or past `_MAX_SYMLINK_HOPS`, which every caller treats as a refusal. The trust QUESTION stays with the caller, because the sites ask different ones and must keep asking them: `_is_root_owned_path` (`trusted_aws_bin`: root's alone to change), `github_runner.validate_provider_executable` POSIX branch (not another uid's, not world-writable unless sticky; strict mode root-owned and unwritable), `browser_cli.install._gateway_writable_component` POSIX branch (not writable by this gateway process), `service.apparmor._substitutable_by_others` (no `0o022` bit, no third-account owner). Windows branches keep their ACL-driven lexical chains; the walker is `os.sep`-rooted and does not model drive anchors or junctions | `realpath` and then `.parents` / `os.path.dirname` (collapses the chain, so a hop through writable space — `gh -> /tmp/link -> /usr/bin/gh` — is never stat'd); a lexical `.parents` walk over the spelling as given (`os.stat` follows symlinks and `dirname` does not, so for `/usr/local/bin -> /opt/x/bin` the target's parent `/opt/x` is never visited); or walking BOTH endpoints' lexical chains (still names no hop in the middle). Adding a fourth spelling of the walk for a new site |
| Spawn the AWS CLI (`aws`) | `trusted_aws_bin()` — `trusted_system_bin` plus a `/usr/local/bin` fallback (the installers' default `--bin-dir`), accepted only when `_is_root_owned_path` finds every entry of `traversed_components` (see the row above: every directory the walk reads, including the directories on a symlinked component's target side, plus the final target) root-owned, not group/world-writable, and (via `os.access(..., effective_ids=True)`, the only form that reads a POSIX ACL) not writable by the non-root account through an ACL entry `st_mode` cannot express. Running AS root DECLINES: there `os.access` answers True for everything, so the ACL arm has no signal, and the entry it would catch grants a NON-root user write — the one case root must not execute. Only the `/usr/local/bin` fallback is lost under root; `trusted_system_bin` does not route through this. The fallback also refuses a `#!` SCRIPT (`_is_native_program`): a shebang names its interpreter in the file's CONTENT, which the path walk never validated, and `sudo pip install awscli` against a pyenv Python produces exactly that — AWS CLI v2 ships a native executable, so the case this exists for is unaffected. Both conditions live in ONE predicate, `_local_aws_bin_is_trusted`, because the resolver and `aws_bin_declined_on_ownership` both ask and must never contradict each other about one file. Debian policy has `/usr/local` subdirectories `root:staff` mode `2775`, so the fallback DECLINES by default on stock Debian/Ubuntu: intended, because a `staff` member can replace the binary. A diagnostic must then report the decline with `aws_bin_declined_on_ownership()` rather than as absence | adding `/usr/local/bin` to `_TRUSTED_SYSTEM_BIN_DIRS` (Intel macOS Homebrew owns that directory as the console user, so membership alone would let a same-uid process supply `ps`, `lsof` and every other pinned tool); or validating the path with `realpath` (collapses a chain, so a hop through writable space vanishes) or a lexical `dirname` walk (`os.stat` follows symlinks and `dirname` does not, so a symlinked component's target ancestors are never seen) |
| Read a Windows system tool's ANSWER (`schtasks /Query`, `tasklist`, `sc query`) | the tool's **exit code**, or a fact the program under test recorded itself | parsing its stdout (column headers AND status words are translated by the UI language, so a match on `"Running"` reports every instance down on a non-English host — the fail-OPEN direction) |
| strftime no-pad | `strftime(dt, "%-I")` | bare `dt.strftime("%-I")` (`ValueError` on Windows) |

**Its relationship to `pinned_fs`.** That module owns this discipline and says so —
mechanism in one place, callers as thin consumers — and `PinnedDirectory` is the
cross-platform arm of it, not a second opinion. What decides the split is the import
direction: `pinned_fs` imports THIS module for its Windows no-reparse open, so nothing
here can import it back. The Windows arm has to live at this layer anyway, because it IS
platform mechanism (`CreateFileW`, a share mode omitting `FILE_SHARE_DELETE`,
`st_file_attributes`) rather than the `dir_fd` discipline `pinned_fs` is built from —
and `supports_pinned_walk()` means "`dir_fd` opens are available" to every one of its
existing consumers, which read it to DEGRADE on Windows, so a Windows-capable pin cannot
hide behind that boolean without changing what it promises them. The one thing genuinely
spelled twice is the POSIX open-flag triple (`pinned_dir_flags()` here,
`dir_flags()` there); `test_pinned_directory.py::TestItDoesNotDivergeFromPinnedFs`
asserts the two are equal and records the one place the modules deliberately differ (a
hardlinked file is refused on this read, where `pinned_fs.read_file_pinned` allows it),
so neither can drift without a red test.

## Internal Python child user-site isolation

Every Kiro Crew-owned Python service, helper, and runtime dependency installer that
can run under the bundled interpreter routes argv through `isolated_python_argv`.
The helper adds `-s` for the bundle and for parents whose user site is already
unavailable, removing the interpreter's user-site directory without dropping
`PYTHONPATH`, cwd import behavior, or other required environment settings. A caller
that already carries `-I` stays unchanged; `-I` is stronger because it also ignores
Python environment variables and the cwd. A non-bundled parent that currently allows
the user site preserves that policy because Kiro Crew itself may be installed there.

A module-style child that imports `kiro_crew` from the parent's own user site
keeps the parent's user-site policy. Isolation is forced only when the parent's
own launch rewrite injects the child's import path, never because the child
inherited `PYTHONPATH`. A caller MUST therefore pass `force_isolation=True`
only for that launcher-injected path, such as the path-based dependency shim,
or for a script or entry path that does not import `kiro_crew` from the user
site. The explicit override keeps `-s` on non-bundled, user-site-enabled
interpreters only where removing the user site cannot remove the child target.

This contract does not apply to user-authored cron scripts, project test commands, or
other workloads whose documented environment may include `--user` packages. The
explicit inventory in `test/test_internal_python_isolation.py` names the internal
boundaries. It includes resident runtime workers such as
`piper_runtime.PiperRuntime._start`; their module launches follow the same unforced
parent-policy decision. Adding one requires routing it through the helper and adding it
to that inventory, so a later spawn cannot silently return to the user-site-dependent
behavior.
## Confined decision-log append

`platform_log_append.append_line` owns the decision log's filesystem transaction.
The configured home is resolved once as the trusted anchor; the immediate log
subdirectory and daily file are never resolved through links. POSIX pins the
anchor with `pinned_fs.pin_parent`, creates the directory relative to that pin,
and opens the directory and leaf with no-follow flags. Windows opens the resolved
anchor and the log directory with `FILE_LIST_DIRECTORY` access and read-only
sharing (attribute-only access takes no part in Windows sharing, so it would pin
nothing), rejecting reparse attributes on both, so a data-write or delete open of
either directory is a sharing violation while the append runs. The leaf uses
`CreateFileW` read/write, open-or-create, without following reparse points, and
its `GetFinalPathNameByHandleW` path must equal the pinned directory plus the
leaf name; a swap that landed before the pins is refused rather than written
through. Every native handle or descriptor is closed on failure as well as success.

Fresh POSIX directories/files request 0700/0600; existing modes are untouched.
The leaf is created with `O_CREAT | O_EXCL`. If another creator won or the file
already exists, one non-creating open uses the same pinned directory and retains
`O_NOFOLLOW`, `O_APPEND` and `O_NONBLOCK`. This avoids Darwin's concurrent
nonexclusive-create `ENOENT` without re-resolving the parent or following a
swapped link. A leaf that disappears between that `EEXIST` and the open is one
more lost interleaving: the existing bounded create-directory retry runs the whole
pinned sequence again, so the record is still written, through the same exclusive
no-follow create, under the same resolved anchor. Each failed attempt closes its
descriptors. Exhaustion raises `FileNotFoundError` naming the full path.
Other open errors propagate. Windows keeps its native open-or-create path.
Windows uses inherited ACLs, not a claim that POSIX mode bits enforce privacy.
The open file must be regular and have exactly one hard link. The existing
cross-platform file lock spans EOF validation, short-write/EINTR retries and
rollback. File offsets are explicitly reset inside the lock, including on Windows.
Lock acquisition and retries share a finite deadline that starts once the log is
open, so the create-and-pin ahead of it never spends the budget it cannot be
cancelled by. The OPEN carries a second budget of the same length, spent only on
Windows and only on `ERROR_SHARING_VIOLATION`: another process holding a transient
handle with narrower sharing than the access asked for is what contention looks
like there before the lock is reached, so the open is retried for that one error
while the budget lasts and reports it unchanged afterwards. Two budgets rather
than one because a slow open must not reach the lock with nothing left; the retry
covers the open alone, so no partial write is ever replayed. No additional worker
is spawned; a stalled filesystem syscall itself is not cancellable by either
deadline.

On write failure, rollback removes only the bytes counted for that append when
the file has exactly the expected size. Existing bytes or unrelated growth are
never truncated. A pre-existing torn tail, including one left by failed rollback
or process death, is terminated with a newline before the next record is written,
so one torn row costs one unparseable line and never joins the record after it.
This is best-effort observation, not a
durable journal: no fsync or crash-atomic publication is promised. POSIX locks
serialize cooperating writers, not arbitrary same-user mutations or hostile
filesystem mounts. Descriptor pinning prevents redirected opens, not POSIX rename
of an already-open inode outside its original directory.

The retention sweep reuses the same pin: `pinned_log_dir` yields the no-follow directory descriptor on POSIX (names are listed with `scandir(fd)` and removed with `unlink(name, dir_fd=...)`) and holds the directory handle on Windows, so a swapped directory link cannot redirect a deletion. The decision caller catches append failures and warns without failing its turn.
`test/test_platform_log_append.py` exercises ordinary appends on every platform,
link refusal, short writes, rollback, concurrent writers, deadlines and cleanup.
Native Windows cases also require rename and directory-write-handle exclusion,
refusal of a redirected leaf handle, and release after failed CRT handle
conversion; Linux simulations do not verify these.

## Embedding threading and cancellation

Embedding cancellation uses `threading.Event` and monotonic deadlines on all
supported platforms. It cancels queued work, not a running native inference.
Executor admission follows the underlying future's completion, never the
cancelled asyncio waiter's lifetime. Cache stripes and dispatch locks never
cover native inference; store alignment holds only Python locks and performs
no model load or inference.

## Exact-handle descendant continuity on Windows

An open Windows process handle pins its process object and prevents PID reuse even
through exit; reuse is possible only after exit and the last handle closes
([Windows process-object lifetime](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20110107-00/?p=11803)).
Exact-handle tree discovery retains root/descendant handles through its scans;
retained PIDs cannot hide a replacement while their handles remain open.
Host-effect tests must attempt authoritative teardown in `finally`; OS refusal or
incomplete identity proof must fail loudly and preserve isolated HOME/service
evidence, never certify zero residue or invoke an unsafe duplicate cleanup authority.
Service-free, newly owned precondition cleanup is a separate case.

`windows.stop` requires a boot-contained Job descriptor or a generation-bound
kernel-zero receipt. The CLI reserves the run before scheduling; the supervisor
claims it under a separate short lock, assigns the initial child while suspended,
and atomically publishes its exact identities before resume. A legacy PID record,
marker, HOME or task without that protocol refuses reclamation.

Before `/End`, stop opens the existing Job and pins its publisher and available
initial process by exact identity. Access/query failures never mean death. After
retiring the publisher it requires a successful Job zero-count query and persists
a receipt. A publisher may also publish that receipt as its final action after
draining, with no further child creation or resume. Receipt consumers still retire
the publisher before cleanup. The receipt survives task-deletion, sidecar-deletion
or HOME-cleanup failure. Authoritative teardown must delete the handoff marker,
PID record and result sidecar successfully before consuming the receipt after the
full seven-sweep HOME cleanup. A retry uses the same generation's receipt even if
the Job has disappeared; supervisor-side diagnostic cleanup remains best-effort.
This covers unobserved restart branches without reconstructing dead intermediaries;
marker/PID record removal and polling history do not authorize reclamation.

`descendant_termination_handles` checks every first-snapshot edge against exact
handle creation/exit times, then rechecks identity and lifetime bounds after a
second snapshot. If an observed intermediary exits and disappears from Toolhelp,
its pinned handle preserves the first edge only when the second identity read
confirms the same PID/creation time and a published exit time. A surviving child's
PPID must still agree; its creation time must precede that intermediary's exit.
Changed parent links and positively disproven identities/lifetimes are excluded.
Unknown is not an exclusion: an unopenable candidate must be absent from a fresh,
successful full process snapshot, or be positively disproven by creation order,
or discovery raises `OSError`. Creation order disproves descent because a
descendant is created after the root it descends from: a chain node whose process
already existed before the root holds a recycled PID naming an unrelated process,
so it disqualifies itself and every observed PID whose only ancestry route to the
root runs through it, including a descendant whose own termination handle opened
successfully -- those handles are closed before discovery returns. That instant is
read through a validated query-only handle, which answers where a termination
handle is refused; a node already pinned by a handle is read from that handle
instead, whose object cannot have been recycled. The drop is abandoned wholesale,
and discovery raises, when any disqualified PID is a retained identity: dropping
it would discard authority an earlier scan already proved. Creation order
disproves nothing, and discovery raises, when the instant is unreadable, when the
query-only handle is itself refused, or when the instant is at or after the
root's. Absence alone
is insufficient when that same fresh snapshot contains an entry referencing the
observed, now-vanished unopened parent: discovery refuses even if the child and
its descendants first appeared after the initial snapshot. This guard reports
only a total and at most three child/parent PID pairs, takes no extra snapshot,
and grants no identity or termination authority. A vanished unopened child with
no fresh descendant reference remains admissible.
A false `pid_exists` result is not sufficient because query denial can produce it too.
Unreadable opened/retained identities, missing live objects, and a surviving
child whose vanished unpinned parent has no lifetime proof also raise, so callers
must preserve HOME/task state rather than certify a partial tree as drained.
For an unopenable candidate still present in the fresh snapshot, the refusal
includes failure-only diagnostics for at most three candidates and eight PIDs
per first/fresh ancestry chain. The opener captures the immediate native error
(or Python exception type only); the report includes the root identity at scan
start and current identity/lifetime observations from already-pinned relevant
handles. A separate query-only handle may observe the candidate for this report,
but is always closed and is explicitly unvalidated: no diagnostic observation
changes the refusal or provides kill authority, which is why the creation-order
disproof above is a distinct validated read taken before the refusal is decided.
Diagnostic failures leave the original refusal intact.
No command lines, environment, file contents, or unrelated process inventory
are emitted, and successful discovery does not collect or log this report.
All newly opened handles are closed on failure, including failures partway through
opening candidates; root and retained handles remain caller-owned. Positively
rejected newly opened handles are closed before returning the proven subset.

This covers an **already observed, handle-pinned** chain. An intermediary that died
before it was ever observed/pinned remains unverifiable; a single numeric snapshot
is not enough to recover that chain. The deterministic and self-owned native
regressions are in `test/test_platform_compat.py`, `TestProcessDescendants`.

## Windows session-tree teardown

Windows physical ACP starts reserve cleanup bookkeeping atomically before the
spawn await, across threads and event loops. Both transports use the same
process-wide admission set: `_WINDOWS_CLEANUP_ROOT_LIMIT` is 64 physical trees,
including starting, live, failed and manually quarantined trees. This is a separate
internal cleanup limit, not a change to pool, RSS, Job or timeout configuration.
A live tree keeps its reservation, so simultaneous failures cannot exhaust the
space needed to retain already-admitted roots. A cancelled launch settles its
spawn task and takes ownership of any returned child before attempting cleanup;
only an empty failed-launch reservation or a verified retired tree is refunded.
The suspended-resume worker also settles before cancellation initiates teardown.

The Windows factory capture boundary is the successful native `CreateProcess`
return, before CPython closes child-side pipe descriptors, publishes the Popen
handle, closes the initial thread handle, registers the process wait, or connects
async pipes. The cleanup reservation receives the exact native process handle
there; CPython and cleanup then share one reference-counted `subprocess.Handle`.
A post-creation exception publishes this owner for maintenance even without a
returned asyncio `Process`. Pre-creation exceptions refund the empty reservation.
The initial thread handle also has a per-call reference-counted owner so an early
pipe-descriptor failure cannot skip its release.

The reservation's exact handle is recorded before the tree's identity is read, and
that read runs on `subprocess_executor()` rather than the starting loop. The read
polls for an exit FILETIME the kernel publishes slightly after it reports the exit,
so a child that dies the moment it resumes makes it wait tenths of a second — on a
loop that is serving every other session. Recording the handle first is what makes
the hop safe: a cancellation arriving during the read still leaves this exact child
retained for maintenance instead of dropping it.

This narrowly reuses CPython functions with per-call substituted global bindings;
it does not replace asyncio/Popen globals or install methods on the live loop.
Only the standard CPython Proactor subprocess implementation is admitted; a
different loop implementation refuses before creation. The admission reads private
CPython shapes, so it is version-coupled and the coupling is measured rather than
assumed: the shipped predicate and its capture were exercised against a real child
process on stock Windows CPython 3.12, 3.13 and 3.14 — every minor `requires-python
= ">=3.12"` admits that exists to measure — and a non-Proactor loop was refused in
the same run. `requires-python` carries no upper bound, so a later minor is
unmeasured by construction: it either satisfies the predicate or refuses every
tracked Windows start rather than capturing nothing silently, which is the intended
direction of failure. Both refusals name the measured interpreters, so the remedy
reaches the operator without this file; re-running that measurement is the gate for
adopting a new minor, and the committed form of it is
`test/test_runtime_cleanup_windows.py::test_native_admission_and_owner_shutdown_refund_after_verified_drain`,
which spawns a real admitted tree through this capture on whichever interpreter is
running. It runs on the Windows CI shards, so a minor that reshapes these internals
turns the adoption question into a failing check rather than an archaeology exercise.
POSIX and untracked
Windows launches retain their original path. This is in-process ownership, not
protection against gateway death, interpreter failure or resource exhaustion
inside the native call/capture itself.

`_WINDOWS_CLEANUP_IDENTITY_LIMIT` is 4096 exact objects per tree (root included),
shared by retained handles, signalled identities and terminal-scan identities.
This gives generous build/browser fan-out headroom while bounding retention per
tree; the number of trees is separately bounded by the root reservation cap, so
the aggregate follows from those two named limits rather than a figure recorded
here that would drift when either constant moves. These are engineering
bookkeeping ceilings, not measurements of maximum workload size. Discovery checks
the retained/candidate union before opening new child handles. Its breadth-first
candidate stores share that limit. Toolhelp's unrelated-host input is separately
bounded at `_WINDOWS_CLEANUP_SNAPSHOT_LIMIT` (65536 entries) during enumeration,
not after allocating the complete process table. Snapshot overflow is incomplete
evidence, never an empty tree. Temporary unvalidated candidate handles are closed
on discovery failure; previously owned root/intermediary pins remain retained.

Any identity/snapshot overflow permanently marks the tree
`manual-handling-required` in this gateway process. It keeps its pins and tracking,
receives no automatic refund and is excluded from retries. A later shorter
snapshot cannot clear the mark. New Windows physical starts are refused while
any such mark exists; other already-admitted trees remain owned and can drain.
The transition emits an error with the root PID and retained count. This is
**bookkeeping quarantine, not OS isolation**: unobserved descendants may still
run. No API, eviction rule or successful numeric PID probe clears the condition.
Ordinary transient failures without overflow continue to retry automatically.

Operator recovery is manual: preserve the diagnostics and tracking, stop creating
new work, and use independently verified process ownership to account for and stop
the affected workload, including descendants not represented by the retained
pins. Do not kill a process merely because it reused a logged PID. If complete
ownership/absence cannot be established, a planned host reboot is the reliable
way to end surviving processes (save unrelated work first). Restart the gateway
only after that independent cleanup or host restart. A gateway restart alone
neither terminates all descendants nor proves they are gone; it loses this
process-local quarantine and its pins. Deleting tracking files is not recovery.

ACP runtime and direct-client teardown retain the original asyncio process
object and drain it through `terminate_windows_asyncio_tree`. The Windows
`kill_process_tree_pinned` path uses the same `terminate_windows_process_tree_owned`
operation after confirming the recorded creation identity. Neither path relies
on a still-running root PID or a successful `taskkill` return code.

The bounded worker discovers descendants through exact handles, terminates each
verified object and scans each parent again after confirmed exit. A successful
pass closes every acquired handle. A failed pass from an owning caller transfers
the original root and every already observed intermediary handle into
process-local pending state keyed by the exact root incarnation; it retains no
provider or client object. Repeated transfers deduplicate and close only the
redundant root handle. The existing off-loop
`session_pid.cleanup_orphaned_session_roots` maintenance entry advances a finite,
fair snapshot of that state before its ordinary PID-file orphan scan; a tree
already draining on another caller is skipped with a non-blocking lock and
rotated behind its peers, so one busy entry cannot hold up the sweep (caller-
initiated cleanup keeps its blocking serialization). A denied
tree remains retained and visible and moves behind its peers; only an
exact-handle-verified complete drain retires the state. On completion, a
synchronous maintenance callback retires the session layer's PID-file records
and protected-PID shield WHILE the state lock is held and the exact root handle
still pins the incarnation, BEFORE any handle is closed — so a recycled pid
cannot register fresh tracking between the close and the untrack. The handles are
closed only after that callback succeeds; a transient callback/write failure
leaves the state un-retired with its handles open, so its receipt survives for
the next tick rather than being lost, and an in-flight duplicate owner that has
already completed the same state contributes no second retirement. This is
same-process retry continuity, not crash recovery: the
maintenance path never reconstructs a missing original handle or gains cleanup
authority from a PID, a PID-file entry, or a successful `TerminateProcess`
return. Phase-one periodic PID identification remains non-destructive.

Caller cancellation is delivered after its current cleanup attempt settles.
Unknown identity/ancestry, denied access or a non-draining tree is a failure, not
an empty tree; ACP retains the original process and PID tracking when the owning
call does not complete, while the transferred exact handles remain independently
retryable after provider/client references are dropped.

This does not reconstruct an intermediary that exited before any available
handle observed it, and the completeness a successful drain asserts is therefore
scoped to the members it retains: the pinned root plus every descendant some
snapshot reached through a still-certifiable chain. An ancestry chain that IS
observed but cannot be certified raises rather than certifying a subset — that
much is a refusal, never permission to signal numeric PIDs. A live grandchild
whose only edge to the root ran through an intermediary that exited before the
first scan is a different case and must not be read as covered by that refusal:
Toolhelp reports its parent as a vanished PID, so no walk from the root reaches
it, the drain confirms the exits it can see and reports success, and that
residue falls to the PID-file orphan sweep exactly as it did before this
change. Pinning at spawn closes the window for the ROOT, which is the reaped-root
case this fix exists for; it does not pin an intermediary nobody has seen yet. POSIX teardown and Windows resource Job limits are
unchanged. Native small-process regressions live in
`test/test_runtime_cleanup_windows.py`; deterministic timing/error contracts
live in `test/test_windows_tree_reap.py`.

Reading a handle's identity has two callers with different needs, and the split
is load-bearing. A drain must certify that a member exited, so it asks for the
exit bound and accepts a short poll while the kernel publishes the exit
`FILETIME`. `get_process_start_id` answers a narrower question — which process
object a PID names — and publishes itself as non-blocking and safe to call
directly from the event loop, so its Windows arm asks for the creation half
alone: no liveness wait, no poll, and no sleep on a coroutine's thread. The
creation `FILETIME` is the whole identity, so answering without the exit half
costs the caller nothing.

Teardown deliberately does not keep a Job handle and call `TerminateJobObject`
instead of draining exact handles. The Job that `apply_job_limits` creates is
anonymous and is closed before that function returns, so there is no handle to
retain and no name to reopen; `KILL_ON_JOB_CLOSE` is left unset on purpose,
because setting it would tie an agent tree's LIFETIME to a resource ceiling's
handle. That ceiling is also fail-soft by published contract — a missing Job must
not fail a spawn, and four Win32 call sites log and continue — so making
reclamation depend on it would either turn every ceiling failure into a refused
start or leave exactly the degraded host with no reclamation at all. A Job also
enforces by REFUSING new members rather than killing existing ones, so a
saturated Job is a state the gateway must survive, not a teardown primitive.

## Pod lifetime Job primitives

`pod._windows_job.PodJob` owns pod-specific named Windows Job handles. Creation
uses a unique global name and an owner-only protected DACL, so the scheduler and
CLI can run in different Windows sessions; opening an
existing job never creates one. Assignment borrows the caller's original process
handle and requires a never-resumed `CREATE_SUSPENDED` child. Breakaway and
kill-on-close flags are refused. Membership and accounting errors raise rather
than reporting absence; termination succeeds only after a bounded kernel zero
count. Closing a handle does not terminate members. The shared resource-ceiling
helper and its configuration are unchanged.

The Task Scheduler backend uses these primitives with `pod._windows_run` durable
run identities and publisher retirement. Job emptiness alone is not reclamation
authority. Before attempting `/Run`, a failed start may cancel only its exact
unclaimed reservation under the supervisor's claim lock. The durable `cancelled`
state refuses admission and survives task/wrapper/result cleanup errors; the next
`start` retries that cleanup before reserving a new generation. The claim lock
covers cancellation through receipt deletion. Claimed, malformed or changed-run
records and unexpected HOME/PID/handoff evidence refuse rollback. A failed or
raised `/Run` never grants cancellation, even if no publisher has claimed yet.
If cancellation itself cannot be persisted, the ordinary reservation remains
unresolved rather than being inferred safe on a later invocation.
Native tests exercise owner-only access, descendant containment,
nested resource jobs and breakaway refusal; injected failures run on all hosts.

## Verifying a change

`rename_noreplace` uses the Linux libc wrapper when available. On older glibc
without that symbol, it uses the same kernel operation through `syscall` with
an architecture-specific number. Unknown architectures remain unsupported,
and an occupied destination still refuses atomically. The fallback does not
replace the operation with a check-then-rename sequence.

CI holds all three platforms at the UNIT layer: the `backend-test` shards cover
Linux, `backend-test-windows` covers Windows, and `backend-test-macos` covers
macOS. All three run the whole suite, so a POSIX call that only works on Linux
goes red on the macOS shards rather than shipping — but the macOS shards are
NIGHTLY (`platform-tests.yml`, called by `nightly.yml`), not per-pull-request: a
`macos-15` runner took 176-213 minutes to arrive on the PR path, which is ~64% of a
pull request's CI wall clock, and the queue sat on the required check. So a
POSIX-but-not-Linux regression is caught within a day and before any nightly bytes
are published, rather than before merge. In front of a pull request there is
`macos-on-demand.yml` (the same full suite, called against the PR head, advisory;
runs on a darwin-sensitive path, on the `ci:macos` label, or on a 1-in-20 SHA sample; the path and
sample switches are refused while the lane already holds `LANE_MAX_LIVE_RUNS` live runs of the hosted
macOS pool (the ceiling moves with the shard count, so the value lives in the workflow), the
label never is) and the static side of
this table. A shard passing is still not
evidence that a gateway starts: files listed in
`test/windows-collect-ignore.txt` are excluded on Windows, with further node ids in
`test/windows-expected-failures.txt` and `test/macos-expected-failures.txt`.
What runs a real gateway on macOS and Windows is `ci.yml`'s `e2e-boot-matrix`
job (`test/e2e/test_gateway_boot_matrix.py`), which boots one per test against
the packaged fake ACP backend and asserts a completed prompt turn. Point a
process or signal change at that job, not only at the shards. See
[../../ci/e2e-gate.md](../../ci/e2e-gate.md).

Still run process, signal, file-lock and metrics changes on macOS **and** Linux
locally where you can. A test that only ever runs on the author's platform is how
a silent no-op ships, and a CI red found after the push costs a round trip.

A test that cannot pass on macOS gets a precise
`skipif(sys.platform == "darwin", reason=...)` naming the capability, or its node
id in `test/macos-expected-failures.txt`, the burn-down list applied by the
rootdir `conftest.py`, same mechanism as `windows-expected-failures.txt`. Never
widen a platform assertion to make a red go away.

Frontend support is Chrome, Firefox, Safari and Edge, using standard Web APIs and
guarding the rest (`typeof Notification !== 'undefined'`).
