# Injected messages

Some messages in a session were not typed by a human. Automation injects them:
a cron job reporting, a sub-agent finishing, the runner recovering a broken turn,
a nudge loop poking an idle slot. They arrive on the same queue as user input, so
they need a marker the model and the frontend can both recognise.

**The user may not be present.** Process the envelope and act; do not answer it as
though someone is waiting for a conversational reply.

Dashboard-owned prefixes are defined once in `src/kiro_crew/dashboard/state.py`.
The two core-safe sub-agent completion markers live in `src/kiro_crew/constants.py`
so `subagent.py` can import them without importing the dashboard layer; `state.py`
imports and aggregates them. Classification is by `str.startswith` on the resolved
prefix or prefix tuple, never by a loose regex.

## Cron notification

A cron job called `send_message(session="origin")` and the origin dashboard slot
was reachable. `dashboard/handlers/messaging.py` wraps the text:

```
[Cron notification from "<job name>"]
<content from the cron agent>
[End of cron notification]
```

- Prefix `CRON_NOTIFY_PREFIX = '[Cron notification from '`, terminator
  `CRON_NOTIFY_END = '[End of cron notification]'`. The job label sits between a
  literal `"` pair and the closing `]`; `CRON_NOTIFY_RE` extracts it, falling back
  to `"cron"` when the label is unparseable.
- The label, the text and the title are all redacted (exfiltration URLs, then
  credentials) before the wrapper is built.
- The runner appends it to the slot with role `inject` and a `cronLabel` meta
  entry, so the dashboard renders a compact clock chip instead of echoing the
  wrapper. The text wrapper stays in `content` because that is what the model
  reads.
- If the slot is mid-turn the message is queued as `queued` and drained later; a
  queue at capacity evicts its oldest entry rather than growing without bound. An
  idle slot instead gets an immediate guarded turn.
- When the origin slot is not in memory it is rehydrated from history. A session
  that is genuinely gone (never persisted, deleted, or closed) resolves to nothing
  and delivery falls back to a dashboard notification (plus a Slack DM when the
  caller asked for one), with `(session closed)` appended to the text. No phantom
  empty tab is ever created.

**How to treat it:** do the work it implies. If a cron reports a build failure,
fix the build. There is nobody to ask.

## Structured monitor wake

The probe controller injects an action turn only for a newly actionable
fingerprint. The controller constructs one envelope, and dashboard, Slack, and
Discord pass those exact bytes through:

```
[Monitor wake]
Monitor <id>: pull request <target>; objective: review_ready.
Fingerprint: <fingerprint>. Classification: <reason code>.
Head: <revision>. Changed: <allowlisted canonical facts>.
Next action: <bounded instructions>.
```

`MONITOR_WAKE_PREFIX = '[Monitor wake]'` is defined in `dashboard/state.py`.
The complete envelope is redacted before its 4,096-character cap and contains
only canonical provider facts, never raw responses, logs, comments, diffs,
stdout, or stderr. Dashboard stores it as role `nudge` with compact monitor
identity metadata; messaging surfaces receive the same content. It is
automation, not user speech. A raw provider completion event is the only signal
that the resulting agent action finished.

## Sub-agent completion

A background sub-agent finished. `slack/gateway.py` builds the envelope on the
single completion path that serves every terminal outcome:

```
[Subagent completion event]
Agent `<id>` (<agent name>) <status> <emoji>
Task: <first 100 chars of the task>

Usage: <credits> credits · <elapsed>

<result detail>
```

- `SUBAGENT_COMPLETION_PREFIX = '[Subagent completion event]'` is defined in
  `constants.py` and included in `state.py`'s `SUBAGENT_COMPLETION_PREFIXES`
  aggregate.
- `<status> <emoji>` is one of `completed ✅`, `failed ❌`, or `stopped by user ⏹`.
  The agent-name parenthetical is present only when the sub-agent ran under a named
  agent.
- The detail is the trimmed result when it fits. When the completion copy dropped
  content, or in orchestrator mode, it is a summary plus a `result_path` pointer, so
  the parent reads the full transcript on demand (`read`, `grep`, `spawn_status`)
  instead of re-running the sub-agent.
- Usage is cumulative across all attempted turns in the run, including billed
  retries that failed before the final turn. Providers that do not report credit
  billing render this line as `Usage: <elapsed>`; the missing credit label is
  intentional, and zero is not a claim that the run was free. Reported credits
  use two decimals below 10 and one decimal at or above 10, matching the
  dashboard's precision.
- The same charge is written into the PARENT's crew log as `credits` on
  `subagent/completed` or `subagent/failed`, and `usage.credits_by_source.subagent`
  folds it. This line and that entry read the one accumulator, so they cannot
  disagree; the entry drops an unbilled zero rather than writing it, which is the
  same posture as this line omitting the credit label.
- A user-stopped agent says so explicitly and instructs the parent not to treat the
  partial output as a finished result or retry it unprompted.
- A wide wave is delivered in chunks under a sibling prefix,
  `SUBAGENT_BATCH_COMPLETION_PREFIX`, which `state.py` bundles with the others into
  `SUBAGENT_COMPLETION_PREFIXES` for the same `str.startswith` classification. A
  chunk is NOT the wave: a mid-wave chunk carries progress facts (how many of the
  total are delivered, how many still running) and tells the parent to process
  those results without spawning yet, because more chunks are still arriving. Only
  the final chunk reports the wave finished, carries the run's tallies, and
  releases the spawn-discipline gate.
- The runner appends it with role `subagent`, so it renders as its own message kind
  rather than a user bubble.
- Orchestration guards append to the same envelope when a stage has burned its
  spawn-round budget, telling the parent to stop spawning and ask the user.

**How to treat it:** wait for it rather than polling, then synthesize. After
`spawn_run` the turn is over: continuing to work in the same turn duplicates and
races the sub-agents. Your reply is what the user sees, so fold the results into it
rather than pasting them.

When every agent in a fan-out has completed and each result has been processed, one
further synthesis turn is fired, prefixed `SUBAGENT_SYNTHESIS_PREFIX = '[SYSTEM]
Sub-agent synthesis:'`. Its visible reply is the consolidated, user-facing summary,
so treat it as the deliverable: restate the goal, synthesize across the agents
rather than repeating each in turn, and give concrete next actions.

The prompt itself is appended to the slot as an `inject` row carrying
`meta.injectKind = "synthesis"`, and the turn is dispatched with
`_synthetic_payload=True`. Both matter: the row is what stops the prompt reaching
the conversation log unattributed (it previously replayed as though the user had
typed it), and the flag is what keeps a synthetic turn out of the
time-to-first-token distribution.

## Sub-agent delivery failure

A sub-agent reached a terminal state but injecting its report into the parent
session failed (most commonly a delivery timeout). `subagent.py` builds:

```
[Subagent completion event]
Agent `<id>` ❌ <reason>
Task: <first 100 chars of the task>
Usage: <credits> credits · <elapsed>
<outcome line>
Result saved at: <path> (<n> bytes)
Use the read tool to retrieve it if needed.
```

The outcome line reflects the run's actual terminal state instead of asserting
completion — this path fires for every terminal state, including runs that
never executed (the never-ran reading comes from the record's execution marker,
never from its error wording):

- completed: `The agent finished, but its result could not be delivered.`
  The line names no mechanism: `<reason>` above it already carries one, and
  most call sites pass something other than a timeout (a dead provider, a
  died ACP process, a raw exception string).
- failed after execution began: `The agent failed before a result could be delivered.`
- failed before execution (approval or queued rejection, no output exists):
  `The run failed before it started, so there is no result to deliver.`
- stopped before execution began (no output exists):
  `The run was stopped before it started, so there is no result to deliver.`
- stopped mid-run: `The run was stopped before it completed.`

The result-path lines are present only when a result file exists. **The result is
on disk**, so use the `read` tool to retrieve it rather than re-running the work.

Three adjacent variants exist for a gateway restart, same prefix:
These notices omit usage because an interrupted run has no settled terminal
billing record:

- `⚠️ orphaned by gateway restart` plus `Result saved at: <path>` and
  `Use the read tool to retrieve it.` — only when the run recorded
  `result_complete`, i.e. its stream reached the complete event.
- `⚠️ cut off mid-turn by gateway restart` plus `Partial output saved at: <path>`
  and a line saying the text stops wherever the restart landed. `result.txt` is
  appended per streamed chunk, so a run killed mid-turn leaves a non-empty file
  holding an opening sentence; this variant exists so the parent is not sent to
  read a fragment as though it were the answer.
- `❌ lost to gateway restart` plus `No result was captured before the restart.`
  When the run's conversation is still resumable
  (`session_map.session_files_resumable` on the orphan's `session_id` /
  `provider`), one more line follows: how many turns it completed, its last
  tool call, and the `spawn_continue(conversation="<id>", task=...)` handle
  that resumes it — see `orphan_resume_hint` in
  [subagent](../modules/subagent.md#gateway-restart-reconciliation).

All three are redacted before any delivery path. When the parent has no open
dashboard surface, undelivered notices are batched into a single digest DM rather
than N pings.

## Automatic recovery continuations

## How an `inject` row is rendered

Role `inject` covers several unrelated things, so the render side does not guess
from the text. Every `inject` row carries `meta.injectKind`, stamped at the append
site, and `meta` (unlike an `inject` row's `cls`) survives the persistence
boundary:

| `injectKind` | Row is | Renders as |
|---|---|---|
| `synthesis` | The post-fan-out consolidation prompt | Collapsed one-line note |
| `recovery` | A runner-authored continuation | Its own recovery card, or a generic note if the marker is unrecognised |
| `cron` | A scheduled job's output — the user's own | Labelled bubble (also carries `cronLabel`) |
| `user_replay` | The user's original message, replayed because the turn emitted nothing | Ordinary bubble; it is speech |

`resolveInjectCard` in `website/src/pages/chat/RecoveryCard.tsx` is the single
decision point, shared by `ChatPage` and the `transcriptRenderers` registry so the
surfaces cannot disagree. It prefers a recognised content marker (durable, and
carrying per-kind copy no tag reproduces), then applies a POSITIVE allowlist:
only `recovery` and `synthesis` become a note. Everything else — including a row
with no stamp, written by a gateway older than the field — keeps whatever the
surface drew before, so no history changes rendering underneath the user.

## Turn-recovery continuations

The runner injects a synthetic continuation when a turn ended for a system reason
rather than because the model was done. Each has its own prefix in
`dashboard/state.py`, each renders as an `inject` message (not a user bubble), and
none is mirrored to a linked Slack or Telegram thread as though the user typed it:

| Prefix | Fired when |
|---|---|
| `[Tool refusal — automatic recovery]` | A tool call was refused for a recoverable system reason (a host-gate policy deny, the read-only bash gate, or a PreToolUse hook block) and the in-band notice below could not carry the reason. **Fallback only** — see the in-band note under the table. |
| `[Stalled turn — automatic recovery]` | A genuinely wedged turn was detected and reset. Tells the model the interruption was a system stall, NOT the user, and to resume from its last committed step rather than restart. |
| `[Tool stall — automatic recovery]` | The per-session watchdog judged an in-flight tool dead and cancelled the session. Hands over the stall context so the model can check partial results and continue. |
| `[Interrupted turn — automatic recovery]` | A transient backend 5xx cut a turn short after tokens or tool calls had already streamed. |
| `[Empty response — automatic recovery]` | The model returned no output twice. Continue the pending request; do not restart from scratch or re-run steps that already succeeded. |
| `[Unfinished action — automatic recovery]` | The turn ended right after announcing an immediate action ("I'll do that now") without making the tool call, so nothing actually happened yet a billed turn was recorded. Instructs the model to carry out the announced action now — unless it was actually deferred pending the user's approval or an unmet condition, in which case it is told to hold and say what it is waiting for (a semantic consent backstop, since the terminal-promise detector's approval-gate deny-list cannot enumerate every conditional phrasing). Bounded to one attempt per turn; a second consecutive promise-only ending falls through and lands normally with a give-up notice. |
| `[Connection lost — automatic recovery]` | A reset recovered an interrupted backend connection. The body lives in `chat_utils` so queue provenance and turn routing share one instruction. |
| `[Session busy — automatic recovery]` | A reset recovered a turn the backend refused because the session was still busy. Distinct from the connection marker even though both requeue the same continuation shape: nothing was disconnected, and reporting a dropped connection to a user whose status card reads "Session busy" would contradict the card. |
| `[Context compacted — automatic recovery]` | The backend compacted the conversation mid-turn and then ended the turn without finishing the work. The compaction succeeded, so the turn lands looking clean (a settled footer with elapsed time) and the chat would otherwise just stop. Bounded to one attempt. |
| `[Continue — requested by the user]` | The user pressed Continue on an interrupted turn. It is in this family so `test_recovery_card_prefixes.py`'s cross-language drift guard covers it, but the value deliberately does not say "automatic recovery": a person pressed the button, and the card must not claim the system recovered by itself. |
| `[Tool blocked — reason sent to the agent]` | Display-only. A tool deny's reason was steered into the running turn, so nothing is queued and no turn is dispatched — this row exists so the person sees the same blocked-tool card instead of only a generic "Steered" chip that reads as though they had steered the turn themselves. |

A related notice-only guard handles turns that cannot be replayed safely. When a
normal top-level turn ends after earlier tool calls with a new immediate-action
promise, or its final segment claims foreground work is still continuing, the
runner keeps the completed tool work landed and appends an informational notice:
the main-agent turn has ended, separately shown subagents or monitor loops may
continue, and otherwise the user must send a message to resume. This path never
injects a continuation because replaying a mixed turn could duplicate a push,
deployment, message, or other side effect. The detector is model-agnostic and
matches only first-person progress claims at a sentence boundary; third-person
status statements about a separately shown subagent or monitor are not classified
as foreground work. A first-person claim that the main agent is running or checking
one remains foreground work unless the same sentence delivers the content after a
colon.

**A tool deny is explained IN-BAND first, and the injection above is the
fallback.** ACP's permission response carries only `outcome`/`optionId`, so the
host cannot attach a reason to a rejection — kiro-cli hands the model the fixed
tool result `"User denied tool execution"`, which reads as the person having
clicked No. `chat_runner._steer_policy_notice` therefore steers
`state.build_refusal_steer_notice`'s body into the turn **before** answering the
permission request. Holding the unanswered request is what makes that race-free:
the turn is provably in flight, so the notice is queued and folded in at the next
model-inference boundary — the one right after the rejected tool resolves — and
the model adapts inside the SAME turn. It is opt-in by positive capability
(`supports_refusal_steer`, i.e. `ACP_BACKENDS_STEER`), so a harness without mid-turn
steer is unchanged, and so is codex: its user steer rides `_session/steering`, but its
approval answer cancels the turn and drops what was injected into it.

`should_queue_refusal_recovery` then suppresses the extra turn only when every
refusal got a notice AND a `steering_consumed` echo accounted for all of them. An
unconfirmed notice counts as undelivered: skipping wrongly leaves the model with
kiro-cli's wrong attribution and no correction, while queueing wrongly costs one
turn the model is told twice — which is what this path cost before in-band
delivery existed.

**An approval prompt that expires unanswered takes the same in-band path**, with
its own cause (`approval_timeout`): before the auto-decline is answered on the
wire, the agent is told the prompt expired and that the user did NOT deny the
call — for attended and unattended slots alike, since both are handed the same
generic denial string. It deliberately joins no fallback recovery, and its
notice is tracked outside the turn's refusal ledger so it cannot skew
`should_queue_refusal_recovery`'s count-based decision: the timed-out decline
answers the permission as an ordinary rejection (the recovery continuation
stays reserved for system-side blocks), so on a harness without steer the
unattended transcript line remains the only agent-facing explanation. The
timeout card stays the sole user-visible surface — this steer paints no
tool-blocked row.

**The other two host-originated approval auto-declines take the same path**,
each with its own cause and the same no-ledger, no-row discipline as the
timeout: `approval_no_budget` (the turn had no budget left to host the prompt
— the agent is told the prompt was never shown, to state the permission it
needs, and not to immediately reissue the identical call, since this turn
cannot host an approval wait) and `approval_undeliverable` (the approval card
could not be delivered to the operator's channel — the agent is told the call
was never judged and to state the permission it needs). All three are steered
once, at the shared reject branch, gated on the host-recorded provenance; a
genuine user refusal records no cause, so kiro-cli's generic denial stays the
true attribution there and no notice is sent.

**The headless funnel steers the same notice.** `llm_helpers._resolve_permission`
answers permissions for every surface without a dashboard slot — cron, Slack and
channel turns driven through `stream_and_collect`, workflows, heartbeat, Meetings
transcript turns — and `llm_helpers.run_bg_oneliner` answers them for the
tool-free background one-liners (titles, labels, summaries). Each host deny there
awaits `deny_notice.steer_refusal_notice` through the module's
`_steer_host_deny` immediately before `reject_tool`, naming its cause per site:

- `policy` — a safety rule judged the call itself: an always-deny pattern hit, a
  hook `deny`, the shared permission floor refusing an `AUTO_APPROVE` call.
  Carries the class remediation.
- `surface_policy` — the SURFACE refused the call, not a rule about the call:
  the reject-all and read-only tool policies, the tool-free one-liner, and a
  name-based grant withheld on a surface with no approver to fall back to. No
  remediation, because it is keyed off the reason and the model's own title, and
  on a surface where no tool can run (or no one can approve) it would name a
  sanctioned command the model cannot run there; the withheld-grant reason is
  host-authored and carries no rule identity, so the title would be the only
  anchor.
- `invalid_name` — the call carried no title, the one deny the model can fix.

The one genuine user rejection on that funnel (the interactive approver said no)
sends no notice. Two orderings are load-bearing at every site and are pinned by
a source-walking test (`test_llm_helpers_deny_notice.py`): the SEL audit row is
written BEFORE the steer and the reject (both await the ACP pipe, and a stalled
pipe cancels the coroutine at the turn deadline — an audit sequenced after them
never runs), and an audit that cannot be written raises before the wire, so a
deny never proceeds unaudited — the request stays unanswered and the caller's
own deadline bounds it, exactly as an approval whose audit fails after the wire
keeps raising. A cancellation that lands inside the
steer still answers the wire: the reject is scheduled as a strongly referenced
task whose outcome is read when it settles, and the cancellation re-raises at
once — the cancellation is the caller's deadline, so nothing waits past it.

**The messaging surfaces steer the same notice.** The native Slack handler
(`slack/handler.py`) and the channel-neutral `messaging.TurnDriver` each carry
a thin `_steer_host_deny` that redacts the reason and forwards to
`deny_notice.steer_refusal_notice`; the channel agent stream (`channel.py`)
reuses `llm_helpers`' helper (passing the rendered tool name as `title`), since
its cancellation shape is the same. Each is
awaited immediately before each host-deny `reject_tool` with the SEL row
written first. Per site:

- Slack: the PreToolUse hook's `deny` on the message path — `policy`, with the
  hook's reason; the approval prompt expiring unanswered — `approval_timeout`.
  A Deny click in
  `handle_interaction` and the teardown-only `_reject_orphaned_tool` send no
  notice.
- Channel agents: the containment boundary refusing a direct-to-user messaging
  tool — `surface_policy` (the model's way forward is a channel post); the
  PreToolUse gate's deny — `policy`, with the gate's reason; an approval card the
  channel cannot show in full — the new `approval_oversize` (nothing was judged;
  the model can split the request, and the notice says so — kept apart from
  `approval_undeliverable`, whose guidance is to state the permission needed); a
  card that expired unanswered — `approval_timeout`. The reader's own Deny on
  that same card shares its `reject_tool` line and sends no notice: the steer sits
  under the timeout flag alone.
- TurnDriver: the deny-every-tool switch for a sender other than the operator —
  `surface_policy`; the PreToolUse gate's deny — `policy`. A gate built by
  `messaging.dispatch.build_tool_gate` leaves the hook's reason on itself as
  `last_deny_reason` (the same attribute-on-a-callable shape as
  `ApprovalDecider.last_deny_cause`), so the notice names the rule; a plain
  callable gets a notice naming the gate. The decider path is unchanged: only a
  recorded `approval_timeout` steers, a human's Deny stays bare.

A cancellation inside any of these steers answers the wire through an orphan
reject, and that reject audits ONLY where the caller audits after the wire (the
Slack approval-timeout arm, the TurnDriver's decider path -- `audited=False`);
an audit-first site (`audited=True`) already has its SEL row, and the ledger is
append-only, so a second row for one decision would be a duplicate nothing
reconciles.

`test_messaging_deny_notice.py` enumerates every `reject_tool(` on the three
surfaces with its verdict (host deny / user rejection / cleanup / mixed) and
fails when a site is missing from the enumeration, a host deny is not preceded
by the steer, a user rejection is, or a mixed site's steer is not under its host
guard.

The recovery classification for the last two rows of the marker table above
is **structural**: the queue entry
carries `kind == "synthetic_recovery"` (`SYNTHETIC_RECOVERY_KIND`), set at insert
time. Metadata survives every queue transformation (merge, prefixing, truncation)
and cannot collide with a user pasting the transcript-visible recovery text back
in, which must classify as a plain user message.

There is deliberately no retry cap on refusal recovery: the model decides when to
stop, and the user's Stop button remains the hard breaker.

## Stop-hook continuation

A Stop hook that exits 0 and prints a block decision on stdout asks the harness to
keep the session going instead of ending the turn
([contract](https://kiro.dev/docs/hooks/types#agent-stop)):

```json
{"decision": "block", "reason": "<the instruction to continue with>"}
```

`reason` IS the message. The runner parses the hook outputs collected for the Stop
event — exit-0 stdout, plus the `BLOCKED:` marker `_fire` synthesises for any
exit-2 hook — and each well-formed decision is queued as the next turn behind
`HOOK_CONTINUATION_RECOVERY_PREFIX = '[Hook continuation — automatic]'`. This
lets a hook judge a finished turn and push it further — a gate that checks tests
pass, or one that auto-continues a trivial read — with no round-trip to the user.

- **Nothing failed.** Unlike the recovery continuations above, the turn ran to
  completion; a hook simply asked for another. The card's copy names the hook as
  the cause rather than reporting an interruption. The constant is named into the
  `*_RECOVERY_PREFIX` family only so `test_recovery_card_prefixes.py` covers it —
  a marker outside that family renders as a full-width bubble instead of a card.
- **Only a block decision with a non-blank `reason` continues.** Plain logging
  output, non-JSON, a non-block decision, a block with no reason, and the
  `BLOCKED:` markers an exit-2 hook contributes are all ignored, so an ordinary
  Stop hook stops the turn as before.
- **A continuation is not queued once a stop is pending.** Injection is suppressed
  when a stop is already in progress as the hook output is processed, when a
  session reset is already re-queuing, and when the turn was cancelled by the
  user. A soft stop arriving AFTER the entry is queued does not remove it: the
  first Stop press deliberately preserves the queue, so the entry still drains on
  the next dispatch (behind the session-reset notice). The second press clears the
  queue outright, which is the hard breaker.
- Several hooks' instructions keep firing order: each is inserted at the queue
  front in reverse.
- Entries carry `kind == "synthetic_recovery"` as well as the prefix, so the
  dequeue path classifies them structurally and the flattened message still
  classifies once the metadata is gone — which is what keeps the continuation out
  of a linked Slack thread's user-message mirror.
- **A backstop cap bounds a runaway loop.** `agent.max_stop_hook_nudges` (default 100)
  limits how many consecutive hook continuations a run may take. When the depth reaches the
  cap, the next block decision is refused: no turn is dispatched, and a halt card
  (`[Stop-hook nudge cap reached] #N`) is surfaced instead so the transcript shows the loop
  was force-stopped at depth N. `0` disables the cap — the opt-in for a genuinely unbounded
  feedback loop, where terminating is the hook's own responsibility and Stop stays the
  breaker. The cap exists because the model cannot end a hook loop (even a "nothing left to
  do" turn re-fires the hook); only the hook or this backstop can.
- **The Stop stdin payload carries `hook_continuation_count`**, the depth of the current
  unbroken continuation run (`0` on a normal turn, one deeper per consecutive hook
  continuation), plus `stop_hook_active` as its boolean shorthand (`count > 0`). The Kiro
  contract defines no cap and neither field, so these are additive: a hook may self-limit
  (`if not stop_hook_active: block` continues at most once), threshold on the count, or
  surface it to the model, while a real gate hook checks its own condition and ignores them.
  The depth is tracked on the slot and reset by any non-continuation turn; both keys ride
  beside `assistant_text`, stamped on every Stop fire.
- **Fail-closed by construction**, so no separate guard is needed: with no hook
  store the Stop event produces no stdout, which parses to no instructions and
  queues nothing — and that same branch returns a `BLOCKED:` marker for every
  `PreToolUse` call, so no tool runs at all. A session that cannot govern its tool
  calls cannot produce a continuation either.
- The `reason` is external process output, and it is redacted (exfiltration URLs,
  then credentials) on the dequeue path shared by every queued turn, before the
  continuation is classified or dispatched.

**How to treat it:** it is an instruction from an automation the operator
configured, not a question from a person. Do the work it asks for and continue.

## Auto-nudge cycle

The auto-nudge service runs each bound slot's loop against a persistent deadline
(`next_due_ts`, one full interval after the loop's last cycle). A user message
cancels the pending fire — a nudge never races a human turn — but does not push
the deadline back: when the slot's turn completes (`HOOK_EVENT_STOP`) the timer
resumes toward the same deadline, firing shortly after the turn if it already
passed. Only the loop's own delivered cycles start a fresh interval (measured
from the nudge turn's end). When the timer elapses it injects the nudge as the
next turn into the same slot:

```
[auto-nudge cycle <N>]
[patrol budget: cycle <N>/<max_cycles>, <left>s/<max_runtime_secs>s runtime left]
<nudge message>
```

- `N` is `cycle_count + 1`. Only DELIVERED nudges count toward `max_cycles`.
- The `[patrol budget: ...]` line appears only on a loop with a cycle or runtime
  cap, and names only the caps it has; an uncapped loop's tag is unchanged. It
  ends `; 10% or less left` once either budget is at or under 10% of its cap. It states a
  fact and asks for nothing; the goal-conductor skill is what tells its agent to
  renew on those cycles (`nudge_cycle_header`).
- `{{STOP_FILE}}` in the configured message is substituted with the resolved stop
  sentinel path before the tag is prepended.
- The slot entry uses role `nudge` with a structured `nudge` meta block (`cycle`,
  `loop_id`), so the dashboard shows a compact cycle chip. The body is deliberately
  not duplicated into meta: a multi-KB payload is stored and broadcast once.
- **The visible row and the model's prompt are separate strings, and only an opt-in
  `banner` makes them differ.** With no banner the two carry the same body, so an
  existing loop's transcript is unchanged and `content` is what the model reads. With
  a banner set, `content` carries that short stand-in instead of the message body and
  is no longer what the model reads — the prompt still carries the full message. The
  prompt is never shortened: re-delivering the whole instruction every cycle is the
  guarantee the nudge exists to provide.
- **`banner` is optional on every arming surface** and defaults to absent.
  `POST /api/autonudge` and `PATCH /api/autonudge/{loop_id}` accept it; accepting it
  on `PATCH` is what lets a running loop be quieted without resetting its budgets. The
  MCP tools `monitor_start` and `monitor_update` carry it in their input schemas, and
  `monitor_update` treats an explicit empty string as "clear", so a banner set once can
  be removed without tearing the loop down. It is capped at `MAX_BANNER_CHARS` (500),
  two orders of magnitude under the 8000-char `message` limit, because the two fields
  have different jobs: `message` is an instruction re-delivered to the model every
  cycle, a banner is one display line.
- **A non-blank banner on a channel-bound loop is refused with 400.** A `slack:` /
  `discord:` / `webex:` loop delivers the nudge as the turn's own input and has no
  separate display surface to shorten, so storing one would be dead config the runtime
  could never honour. A blank banner is still accepted there, since that is the default
  every channel-bound caller already passes. A persisted banner is additionally repaired
  at load: a non-string value is blanked, and a persisted string banner is
  credential-scrubbed and re-capped (redaction runs before the cap slice, so a
  secret straddling the cap is masked whole). A caller-supplied banner is also
  credential-scrubbed at the write path with the same `redact_exfiltration_urls` /
  `redact_credentials` passes the `message` field gets, since a banner is persisted and
  served by `GET /api/autonudge`.
- A nudge arriving while the slot is already running is DROPPED, not queued.
  Queueing would stack identical multi-KB payloads and blow the context window; the
  next idle tick schedules again.
- An unattended nudge turn refuses to run without a hook manager, so it can never
  bypass the PreToolUse governance gate. Same fail-closed posture as cron.
- Loops persist to `autonudge.json` under the data home and are re-armed on gateway
  restart. A slot that is unreachable (no history, deleted, or closed) has its loop
  removed.
- **A loop stranded with no live timer is rescued by a periodic reconciler.** A
  dashboard-bound loop's only re-arm path after a delivered fire is the slot's
  `HOOK_EVENT_STOP`; if that never arrives (the nudge turn errors, times out, or is
  cancelled on a hook-skipping path) or a deferred re-arm is dropped mid-fire, the
  loop stays persisted `active` with a finished-or-absent timer and nothing on a
  timer revives it. A finished timer task counts as "no live timer": nothing pops a
  timer from the registry when it completes, so that is the shape the strandings
  actually leave behind. The rescue requires **two consecutive** eligible passes,
  because one observation cannot tell a stranded loop from a slot whose user turn is
  still running or a loop inside another coroutine's mutation window; a user turn
  starting clears the loop's candidacy, so any sign of life restarts the clock. A
  pass that finds the service lock held defers entirely rather than arm a
  mid-rollback shape. Re-arming targets the loop's **own persisted deadline**, so a
  rescue never fires earlier than the schedule the user set. Deliberately skipped
  whatever the passes observe: a loop mid-fire, one quiesced by administrative
  cleanup, a monitor record whose version this gateway does not implement, and an
  in-flight wake claim with no completion-evidence deadline — except a `BUSY` retry,
  the one no-deadline shape that is legitimately live. An **inactive** loop still
  awaiting terminal-completion evidence is deliberately **included**: its accepted-turn
  correlation needs a timer to expire, and stranding it would refuse every replacement
  watch on the slot forever.
- **Delivered fires and reconciler rescues are both logged at INFO.** Fires were
  otherwise unlogged, so a loop that had died and one with nothing to report were
  byte-identical in the journal. One line per delivered turn — each of which already
  spends a model turn — is what makes loop health observable from outside the process.
- **The observation gate fails toward SPENDING.** An exception escaping the
  pre-fire probe gate is treated as "not quiet" and the tick **fires**, matching the
  service-wide invariant that every uncertain path resolves toward spending. Letting
  it escape instead killed the timer task while the registry still held a strong
  reference, so no "task exception was never retrieved" warning was ever emitted and
  the loop went silent. Skipping the tick is the other wrong answer: a gate that
  raises deterministically would keep the loop alive, re-arming and delivering
  nothing forever — the silent mute the gate exists to prevent.
- Structured monitor action accounting is a separate internal completion
  callback, not a new injected-message envelope. Until the probe dispatcher is
  attached, structured records remain fail-closed. The dormant adapters do not
  change the legacy `[auto-nudge cycle N]` body, delivered-cycle count, `fired`
  event, or rearm timing. When attached, dashboard and Discord report only a raw
  provider completion; Slack likewise requires the raw provider completion and
  shares its one consumed usage result with telemetry. A dispatched monitor wake
  that reaches stream exhaustion remains in flight only until its durable,
  bounded completion-evidence deadline; no synthetic completion is injected.

**How to treat it:** it is a self-prompt. Continue the work; the operator asked for
the loop, but is not waiting on this specific message.

## Widget actions

A widget rendered inline via `<mcwidget title="Title">HTML</mcwidget>` can hand
text back toward the session, but it **cannot inject a turn**. The path is:

1. Inside the sandboxed iframe, a click on a `[data-action]` element collects
   `data-action`, `data-payload`, and any form-field values, then
   `parent.postMessage({type: 'mc-widget-action', action, payload}, '*')`.
2. The parent (`WidgetFrame.tsx`) validates the shape: the action must be a string
   (truncated to 64 chars), the payload must be a plain object, and the composed
   text is capped. It formats `[UI] <action>: <JSON payload>` (or `[UI] <action>`
   with no payload) and dispatches an internal `mc-widget-send` event.
3. `ChatPage.tsx` **pre-fills the composer** with that text and records it
   (the `mc-widget-send` listener in `useAutoSendIntake`,
   `website/src/pages/chat/page/launchIntake.ts`). It never auto-submits.

The iframe's own `isTrusted` click check is NOT the trust boundary and must not be
treated as authoritative: LLM-emitted `<script>` in the same document can
`postMessage` directly and skip that handler entirely. The real protection is that
the parent requires an explicit human gesture, so a widget action can never become
a user-role turn on its own.

When the user does send the pre-filled text, the turn is tagged
`meta.origin = 'widget'`. The backend then refuses the one chat-text-reachable
privilege escalation for such turns: orchestrator `go` / `go all` auto-run is
denied (audited as `auto_run_denied`) and the text falls through to a normal, fully
gated turn. Mode changes and tool approvals live on separate endpoints an iframe
cannot reach.

So there is no `[Widget action event]` envelope. What reaches the session is an
ordinary user message beginning `[UI] `, sent by a human, carrying an origin tag.

## Other injected envelopes

These carry no `state.py` prefix constant, so they are classified by their own
literal header rather than through `str.startswith` on a shared prefix. The
system prompt names each one so the model reads it as data or as automation
speech rather than as the user.

| Envelope | Emitted by | What it means to the model |
|---|---|---|
| `[work ledger — …]` | `session_ledger.py` snapshot builder, composed into a nudge by `dashboard/handlers/autonudge.py` | Durable per-session state that outranks the model's recollection of earlier cycles. |
| `[Hook context:]` … `[End of hook context]` | `context.py` hook-context assembly | Context supplied by a configured hook whose action is `HOOK_INJECT_CONTEXT`; webhook-restored workflow state is one producer, not the envelope's only meaning. The payload is untrusted third-party data. |
| `[Previous run result — do NOT repeat the same content]` | `cron_service/identity.py` (`build_cron_session_context`) | A recurring cron's own last output, so the turn reports only what changed. |
| `[RESOURCES]` | `resource_status.py` advisory builder | Host memory crossed the tight/critical threshold, **or** the agent slice sits within `_SLICE_TASKS_TIGHT_RATIO` of its cgroup `pids.max`; take the lighter path this turn. |
| `[Relevant skills for this message]` | `skill_runtime/delivery.py` pointer renderer (`trigger_hint`) | Skill candidates named by path instead of by injected body. The body must be read before use unless that skill already appears earlier in the conversation, where native history still carries its instructions. |
| `[INCOGNITO SESSION]` / `[TEMPORARY SESSION]` | `dashboard/chat_utils.py` ephemeral-session prefixes | An instruction, not a tool-level gate: it forbids memory tools (writes in incognito, reads as well in temporary) and learns nothing from the chat — the transcript itself is kept in History for the user, but no lesson, memory or summary is derived from it. `learn_remove` and the cron tools stay permitted as active user actions, and a cron change persists outside the transcript. |

## Adding a new envelope

- Define the prefix in `dashboard/state.py` next to the others.
- Classify with `startswith` on that constant, and if the entry must survive queue
  transformations, tag the queue entry's `kind` instead of matching content.
- Decide the slot role (`inject`, `subagent`, `nudge`) so the frontend renders it
  as machine-originated, not as a user bubble.
- Redact before every delivery path, not just the one you are adding.
- Make sure it is not mirrored to a linked messaging surface as user input.
- If it triggers an unattended turn, keep the fail-closed hook-manager requirement:
  an automation-driven turn must run under the PreToolUse governance gate.
