# Code style: constants, comments, lint

## No hardcoded values in business logic

Every limit, timeout, protocol string and user-facing label has ONE owning
module. A literal inlined at a call site cannot be found, tuned, or tested, and
the second copy of it drifts silently.

Before adding a constant, check the table for an existing owner. Module-level
constants are `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE`; private ones are `_UPPER_SNAKE_CASE`.

Paths below are relative to `src/kiro_crew/`.

| Concern | Owning module | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| ACP protocol strings | `acp/types.py` | `EVENT_*` event kinds and `METHOD_*` JSON-RPC method names. |
| Provider event kinds | `providers/base.py` | Re-exports the `EVENT_*` names from `acp/types.py`; that re-export is the seam providers code against, not a second definition. |
| ACP client timeouts | `acp/client.py` | `_INIT_TIMEOUT`, `_DEFAULT_PROMPT_TIMEOUT`, `_READ_TIMEOUT`, `_STALE_TURN_TIMEOUT`, `_TOOL_STALL_TIMEOUT`, `_WAIT_RESPONSE_MAX_TIMEOUT`, `_SEL_AUDIT_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`. |
| MCP protocol version | `mcp_shared.py` | The `initialize` reply's `protocolVersion` for the managed stdio servers. `mcp_cron.py` / `mcp_core.py` do not carry their own copy. |
| Credential keys | `config/loader.py` | `CRED_*` env-var names plus the `CREDENTIAL_KEYS` tuple. |
| Dashboard port | `config/loader.py` | `_DEFAULT_PORT` (5476) and `DASHBOARD_PORT` (honors `KIROCREW_PORT`). `dashboard/origin.py` imports `_DEFAULT_PORT` rather than restating it. |
| Hook results and event names | `hooks.py` | `HOOK_PASSTHROUGH` / `HOOK_REPLY` / `HOOK_MODIFY` / `HOOK_INJECT_CONTEXT`, the tool verdicts `TOOL_ALLOW` / `TOOL_AUTO_APPROVE` / `TOOL_DENY`, and `HOOK_EVENT_*` / `HOOK_EVENTS`. |
| Memory paths and dir names | `memory.py` | `WORKSPACE_DIR_NAME`, `MEMORY_DIR_NAME`, `HISTORY_DIR_NAME`, `PREFERENCES_FILE`, `PROJECTS_FILE`, `INDEX_DB_FILE` (the FTS index *name* only — which directory a given store's index sits in is store policy, owned by `memory_stores.memory_index_path_for`). |
| Named memory stores | `memory_stores.py` | `MEMORY_STORES_DIR_NAME`, `DEFAULT_MEMORY_STORE`, `MEMORY_DB_FILE` (the vector-store filename, which `vector_memory._DB_FILE` aliases rather than restating), `MEMORY_STORE_NAME_MAX`, `_STORE_NAME_RE`, `_WINDOWS_RESERVED_BASENAMES`; the tree's host-local entries `MEMBER_API_KEY_FILE`, `MEMBER_BACKUPS_DIR_NAME`, `EXECUTION_LOGS_DIR_NAME`, `STORE_BACKUP_DIR_NAME` (which `memory_backup.BACKUP_DIR_NAME` aliases), and the layout predicates `is_host_local_store_state` / `named_store_product_file` the snapshot and export read. A stdlib-only LEAF module, so `security.py` can build its sensitive-path fence from `MEMORY_STORES_DIR_NAME` without a cycle. |
| Lesson limits | `learn.py` | `_LESSONS_FILE`, `_MAX_LESSONS_TOTAL` (prune oldest past the total). |
| Cron limits | `cron_service/store.py`, `fields.py`, `model.py`, `schedule.py`; the reaper intervals in `cron.py` | `_CRONS_FILE`, `_STORE_VERSION`, `_MIN_INTERVAL_SECS`, `_JOB_TIMEOUT_SECS`, `_TIMER_POLL_SECS`, `_AUTO_PAUSE_THRESHOLD`, the reaper intervals, the skip-date horizon, the store file-lock timeouts, and the hourly/daily jitter caps. |
| Session and transcript limits | `history.py` | `SESSIONS_DIR_NAME`, `ARCHIVE_RETENTION_DAYS`, the JSONL rotation pair `_SESSION_MAX_BYTES` (10 MB) / `_SESSION_KEEP_LINES`, the file-lock timeouts, and the search caps (`SEARCH_MIN_CHARS`, `_SEARCH_SCAN_WINDOW`, `_TITLE_BOOST`). |
| Context budgets | `context.py` | `_CONTEXT_BUDGET_BASE` plus one `_budget(fraction)` cap per block (history, preferences, projects, lessons, semantic, episodic, skills, steering, compressed history, preamble headroom). Budgets are expressed as FRACTIONS of the base, so read them there rather than quoting a byte figure. |
| Inline-image budgets | `imaging.py`, `image_ledger.py` | Per image: `MAX_IMAGE_EDGE_PX`, `MAX_IMAGE_B64_BYTES`, `MIN_IMAGE_EDGE_PX`, `MAX_IMAGE_SOURCE_PIXELS` in `imaging.py` (`acp/prompt_blocks.py` re-exports the first two and owns the pre-encode `MAX_IMAGE_BYTES`). Per prompt and per session: `MAX_PROMPT_IMAGE_BLOCKS`, `MAX_PROMPT_IMAGE_B64_BYTES`, `MAX_SESSION_IMAGE_B64_BYTES`, `MAX_LEDGER_HASHES` in `image_ledger.py`, expressed as shares of the smallest measured backend request-body ceiling, so read the share there rather than quoting a byte figure. Both are LEAF modules. |
| Task states | `task.py` | The `TaskState` enum, the `_TERMINAL` set, and the `_TRANSITIONS` map that defines the legal state machine. |
| Heartbeat intervals | `heartbeat.py` | `_DEFAULT_INTERVAL`, `_FTS_REBUILD_TICKS`, `_PRUNE_TICKS`, `HEARTBEAT_TASK_TIMEOUT_SECS`, `HEARTBEAT_FILE`. |
| Subagent limits | `subagent.py` | `_MAX_CONCURRENT`, `_TIMEOUT_SECS`, `_TURN_LIMIT`, `_MAX_DONE_RESULT_LEN`, `_STARTUP_TIMEOUT_SECS`, `INJECTION_TIMEOUT`, the reaper/stall intervals. |
| Slot state caps | `dashboard/state.py` | `_MAX_SLOT_MESSAGES`, `_MAX_PERSISTED_NOTIFICATIONS`, `_MAX_SOURCE_LINKS_PER_SLOT`, `_MAX_PENDING_CONTEXT`, `NATIVE_SUBAGENT_DONE_RESULT_CAP`, `_QUESTION_TIMEOUT_MAX`. |
| Injected-message envelope prefixes | `constants.py`, `dashboard/state.py` | `constants.py` owns `SUBAGENT_COMPLETION_PREFIX` / `SUBAGENT_BATCH_COMPLETION_PREFIX`; `dashboard/state.py` owns the cron, monitor, synthesis, and `*_RECOVERY_PREFIX` markers and aggregates `SUBAGENT_COMPLETION_PREFIXES`. See [injected-messages](injected-messages.md). |
| Usage cache TTLs | `dashboard/handlers/usage.py` | `_CACHE_TTL`, `_TOKEN_CACHE_TTL`, `_CONTEXT_CACHE_TTL`, `_TOKEN_HISTORY_DAYS`, `_CONTEXT_TOP_SESSIONS`. |
| Webhook hook limits | `dashboard/handlers/hooks.py` | `_HOOK_MAX_CONCURRENT` (semaphore-backed, 429 past it), `_HOOK_MESSAGE_MAX_LEN`, `_HOOK_TIMEOUT_DEFAULT` / `_HOOK_TIMEOUT_MAX` (both prime, to avoid a thundering herd with cron intervals). |
| Embed cache | `embeddings.py` | `_EMBED_CACHE_MAX` (128 entries, keyed by text plus model id; the comment there carries the memory arithmetic). |
| Bytecode-cache GC limits | `pycache_gc.py` | `PYCACHE_MAX_AGE_DAYS`, `PYCACHE_MAX_TOTAL_BYTES`, `PYCACHE_GC_INTERVAL_SECS` (the `<data home>/cache/pycache` TTL, size cap, and periodic-sweep cadence). |
| Slack UX strings and pacing | `slack/handler.py` | `_THINKING`, `_CURSOR`, `_NO_RESPONSE`, `_STATUS_WORKING`, `_TRUNCATION_MARKER`, plus `_EDIT_INTERVAL`, `_APPROVAL_TIMEOUT`, `_SLACK_SECTION_TEXT_LIMIT`, the stall thresholds and the phase debounce. |
| Cross-cutting shared constants | `constants.py` | `KIROCREW_SPAWNED_ENV`, `ENV_TRUTHY`, `CHAT_TURN_TIMEOUT`, `COMPACT_WAIT_TIMEOUT_SECS` (one budget, shared by manual and automatic compaction), the `[OPTIONS:]` parse regexes, `BANNER`, `MAX_BANNER_CHARS` and `ARTIFACT_MAX_CONTENT_BYTES` (bounds `validation.py` — a leaf — must read without importing the service module that enforces them; `artifacts.MAX_CONTENT_BYTES` re-exports the latter). |
| Gateway shutdown budget | `gateway_shutdown_budget.py` | Gateway cooperative timeout, service-manager signal margin, and the derived systemd/launchd stop deadline. |
| Process-wide shutdown signal | `__init__.py` | `shutdown_event`. Background loops `await shutdown_event.wait()` with a timeout instead of a plain `asyncio.sleep`, so they wake instantly on Ctrl-C. |
| Base agent config | `config/defaults.json` | `tools`, `allowedTools`, `resources`, `hooks`, model. Packaged as package data, so editing it needs no code change. |
| Managed MCP server specs | `agent.py` | `_MANAGED_MCP_SERVERS`: which servers are auto-registered and refreshed while preserving user customizations. |
| AgentCore policy-field validators | `platform/agentcore_schema.py` | `AGENTCORE_GATEWAY_URL_MAX`, `WORKLOAD_NAME_MIN` / `WORKLOAD_NAME_MAX`, `normalize_agentcore_gateway_url`, `normalize_agentcore_workload_name`. AWS-free so governance can parse a policy without the optional extra. |
| Built-in skills | `builtin_skills/<name>/SKILL.md` | Frontmatter (`always`, `triggers`, `dir`) is the skill's own contract. This is the only tree copied into a user's `~/.kiro/crew/skills/`, so a skill any shipped feature, tool or doc references MUST live here. The top-level `skills/` tree is repo-checkout-only and reaches no installed user. |

Other style rules:

| Rule | Requirement |
|---|---|
| Line length | 100 chars (black and isort are both configured to it) |
| Python version | >= 3.12; `from __future__ import annotations` for type hints |
| Imports | `import logging` plus `logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)` |
| Async | `asyncio` throughout; `async def` for all I/O |
| Module-global asyncio primitives | Never a bare `asyncio.Lock()`/`Event()`/`Queue()` at module scope — it binds to the import-time (or first-use) loop and raises `RuntimeError` from any other loop (Python 3.10+). Use `kiro_crew.loop_lock.LoopBoundLock` for locks, or create the primitive inside the coroutine. CI enforces this (`loop-bound-locks` gate). |
| Dataclasses | `@dataclass` for data containers |
| Product name | The product is **Kiro Crew**: two words, a space, capital `K`. Identifiers keep the spelling their own system gave them (the `kirodotdev/KiroCrew` repo slug, `KiroCrew.dmg` artifacts, the `KiroCrew Nightly` OS identifier, the `kirocrew` CLI, `KIROCREW_*` env vars, `kiro_crew` imports). CI gates the lines a change ADDS, so an existing spelling nearby does not exempt a new one; run `BRAND_BASE_REF=origin/main python3 scripts/check_brand_name.py` before pushing. |
| Errors | ACP exceptions live in `acp/transport_errors.py` (re-exported by `acp/client.py`), `acp/session_handle.py`, and `acp/runtime.py`; return error strings at tool boundaries. See [error-handling](error-handling.md). |

## Comments explain the WHY

A comment carries what the code cannot: invariants, edge cases, units,
non-obvious constraints, and the reason a surprising choice is correct. It is not
a restatement of the line below it, and it is not a task log.

Do NOT put in a comment or docstring:

- PR or review numbers, review-round or finding markers, ticket ids
- incident dates, milestone tags, commit SHAs
- historical narration: "previously", "used to", "we now", "no longer",
  "historically", "Status: implemented"
- a change's place in a sequence of changes: "hotfix", "follow-up to",
  "regression for", "round N", "GPT round", "review round"

That history lives in git. State CURRENT behavior in present tense. A comment that
narrates a change is stale the moment the next change lands, and a reader cannot
tell whether it describes the code in front of them.

Keep them concise. `_vendor/` (vendored third-party code) and pragma comments
(`# type: ignore`, `# noqa`) are exempt.

`scripts/check_comment_history.py` enforces this, and the list above IS its rule
set: every phrase named there is a pattern in the script, and the script matches
nothing the list does not name. It reads only comment tokens and docstrings, so a
string literal that is not a docstring is never scanned and a user-facing message
using one of these phrases is fine. Present-tense purpose is not narration:
"regression test pins this shape" passes, "regression for the truncated parse"
does not.

The gate is diff-scoped, like the brand-name gate: it judges only the lines a
change ADDS, measured against `COMMENT_HISTORY_BASE_REF` (the PR's base in CI).
Added lines are complete for regression — a line only reaches `main` through a
diff that added it — and they are the only lines a contributor can act on. There
is no baseline file: a shared per-file count would make one JSON the merge-conflict
hotspot of every cleanup PR. The legacy markers the tree still carries are not
tracked; a marker can re-enter only on an added line, which is what the gate
judges. Without the env the script prints whole-tree counts and does not enforce.

```bash
COMMENT_HISTORY_BASE_REF=origin/main python3 scripts/check_comment_history.py
```

## The lint pitfalls

The blocking gates are black (baselined), the subprocess-encoding gate (baselined), the comment-history gate (diff-scoped), isort, flake8 and mypy. Run them before
committing:

```bash
python3 scripts/check_black_formatting.py && python3 scripts/check_subprocess_encoding.py
COMMENT_HISTORY_BASE_REF=origin/main python3 scripts/check_comment_history.py && isort src/kiro_crew test
flake8 src/kiro_crew test && mypy src/kiro_crew
python3 scripts/local-gate.py
```

The last line runs the tests related to your diff, not the full suite -- that is
CI's job (`local-gate.py --full` exists for a human who wants it locally).

`black --check` cannot be run bare: 1,420 files under `src/` and `test/` predate
any enforcement, so a repo-wide run reformats ~95,800 lines. Those files are
recorded in `.github/black-baseline.txt` and exempted; every other file must be
clean, and a file that *becomes* clean must be pruned from the list, so it only
ever shrinks. Format what you touched with
`black --target-version py310 <paths>`, never the whole tree.

**On macOS, run `mypy --platform linux src/kiro_crew`.** CI type-checks on Linux, and
typeshed guards `os.listxattr` / `getxattr` / `setxattr` behind
`sys.platform == "linux"` even though macOS has them. A bare local run therefore
reports errors in files you did not touch, and — the half that matters — it MISSES the
Linux-only errors CI fails on, so a clean local run is a false green.

| Gate | Rule | Detail |
|---|---|---|
| flake8 F401 | No unused imports. | Remove any import not directly used in the file. A pyflakes check, always on. |
| flake8 N806 | Function-local variables are lowercase: `mock_client`, not `MockClient`. | Needs the `pep8-naming` plugin in the flake8 environment. The repo's pinned `flake8==7.1.0` alone does not report it, so an N806 that passes locally can still be flagged by a reviewer or a differently-provisioned environment. In-function Windows API constants carry `# noqa: N806`. |
| flake8 W504 | Line break BEFORE a binary operator, not after. | Both W503 and W504 are in pycodestyle's DEFAULT_IGNORE, and `setup.cfg` uses `extend-ignore` (not bare `ignore`) precisely so those black-compatible defaults stay in effect. So neither fires in a normal run; W503 is additionally listed explicitly because black formats that way. Write it operator-first anyway, because that is what black produces and what the codebase reads like. |
| mypy | Annotate empty collections: `output: list[str] = []`. | `check_untyped_defs = true`, so this fires inside unannotated functions too. mypy only needs the annotation when it cannot infer the element type from the same scope, which is why an `out = []` that is immediately `append`ed and returned from an annotated function is fine. |
| pytest | `asyncio: mode=strict`, so every async test needs `@pytest.mark.asyncio`. | Without the marker the coroutine is collected but never awaited, and the test passes having run nothing. |

`setup.cfg` also sets `max_line_length = 100`, ignores E501 (after auto-formatting
the only long lines left do not matter) and E203 (black's whitespace before `:`),
and excludes `src/kiro_crew/_vendor` from flake8 entirely. mypy and isort exclude
it too. Never hand-edit vendored code, and never reformat it: the point is a clean
diff against the upstream wheel at upgrade time.

The formatter, linter and type-checker are pinned to exact versions in both
`setup.cfg`'s `dev` extra and `pyproject.toml`'s `dependency-groups`, because
black and mypy change their output across minor releases and a floating range
makes a local venv disagree with CI. Bump them in lockstep.

## Subprocess output is decoded explicitly

A text-mode subprocess call (`text=True` / `universal_newlines=True`) without an
explicit `encoding=` decodes the child's output with the locale's code page —
UTF-8 on POSIX, the legacy ANSI code page on Windows, where any non-ASCII byte
becomes mojibake (#3219). CI gates this with
`scripts/check_subprocess_encoding.py` (AST-based, so multi-line calls are
judged as one call), behind the shrink-only
`.github/subprocess-encoding-baseline.txt`.

For a child whose output encoding is knowable — `git`, `gh`, a Python
interpreter we spawn running our own code — pin the decode with the shared
definition in `kiro_crew.subprocess_utf8`: splat `**UTF8_TEXT` into the call
(this keeps the call going through the module's own `subprocess` attribute, so
tests that patch it by name keep intercepting — and it adds no new spawn
primitive for `test_spawn_audit` to police). For a Python child, also pin the
EMIT side with `env={**os.environ, "PYTHONIOENCODING": "utf-8"}`: piped stdout
on Windows otherwise re-encodes with the ANSI code page before the decode ever
sees it. Standalone scripts that cannot
import the package write `encoding="utf-8", errors="replace"` inline. A child
that genuinely writes in the console encoding (`ps`, `systeminfo`, user shells)
keeps locale decoding and says so with an inline `# subprocess-encoding: locale`
marker — an audit trail, not an escape hatch.

## Frontend

Icons are `lucide-react` components with `className="lucide-inline"`. Never an
emoji in the UI, never a hand-rolled SVG.

Never hardcode a user-facing English string, and never format a date, number or
sort order without naming a locale. Both are CI-gated; see
[../../ci/i18n-gates.md](../../ci/i18n-gates.md). Backend-owned strings (built-in
app manifests, HTTP error bodies) have no catalog path, so a new non-2xx JSON body
MUST carry a machine-readable `code` field the frontend can translate.

Full frontend conventions live in `website/AGENTS.md` and `website/docs/`.
