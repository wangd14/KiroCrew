"""Every seam that hands a session a project directory is accounted for.

The structural pin over the project-identity class. Review found that class one
seam at a time -- the restart re-pin, the side panel, the crewmate threads, the
warm pool, the ``session_create`` child, the folder-inheritance arm -- each a
path that handed a session a directory without the identity the binding had
verified. A session's spawn directory is ``<slot>.project``, so every such path
is one of two shapes, both found by AST rather than by reading, and a new one of
either shape lands on this module before it lands on a review.
