# OpenCode frame corpus

Six files, all live. Read `../README.md` first for what a fixture is and what
the corpus does and does not prove.

| File | Provenance | Frame classes it carries |
|---|---|---|
| `session-live.jsonl` | live | initialize response with `agentInfo.version`, `session/new` response with a `sessionId`, `agent_message_chunk`, `usage_update`, and the `session/prompt` result carrying `stopReason` |
| `tool-call-live.jsonl` | live | `tool_call`, and two `tool_call_update` frames (`in_progress`, then a terminal `failed`) -- a call the harness rejected against its own argument schema |
| `permission-request-live.jsonl` | live | `tool_call`, `session/request_permission`, and the `tool_call_update` frames through to `completed` with the command's real output |
| `session-load-live.jsonl` | live | a `session/load` from a second process: the replayed `user_message_chunk` / `agent_message_chunk` updates and the load result, which carries `configOptions` and no `modes` |
| `mcp-directive-call-live.jsonl` | live | a Crew MCP `tool_call`, its `in_progress` refinement and its terminal `tool_call_update` -- the single-underscore `kirocrew-core_<tool>` title, an empty-then-refined `rawInput`, and a result carrying a directive marker |
| `compact-live.jsonl` | live | a MANUAL `/compact`: an ordinary turn's `usage_update` and `stopReason`, then the `/compact` turn's summary `agent_message_chunk`, its far smaller `usage_update`, and its `stopReason: end_turn` with NO compaction status frame |

Captured off `opencode acp` 1.18.30 driving a local Ollama model, agent-to-client
lines verbatim, with the recording user's home directory replaced by `~`.
`tool-call-live.jsonl` is a **slice**: the 430 `agent_message_chunk` frames the
model emitted around the tool call are omitted for length, and the fixture's own
`_meta.note` says so.

## What the permission capture establishes

The permission frame is the one the enforcement story rests on. Kiro Crew's tool
gate runs only when a harness sends `session/request_permission` for a tool call,
and OpenCode sends it only while its own `permission` setting says to ask. The
session's read-back (`AcpClient._verify_opencode_routing`) proves that setting is in
force; it cannot prove the harness then asks. `permission-request-live.jsonl` is that
second half, observed: with `permission: ask` resolved, OpenCode emitted
`session/request_permission` before running `bash`, waited for the client's
`allow_once`, and only then ran the command.

Two things it does *not* pin. It was observed on OpenCode 1.18.30, and nothing in
this repository pins per-call emission across upgrades the way the read-back pins
config precedence -- `agent-host-contract.md` records the version. And the
recording model garbled the echo text (`kirocrew-op encode-live`); that is the model,
and it is left verbatim because an edited frame is no longer evidence of what the
wire carried.

The earlier capture in `tool-call-live.jsonl` shows the other path: a call whose
arguments fail OpenCode's own schema is rejected BEFORE any permission check, so no
permission frame exists for it. Both fixtures are kept because they are different
facts about the same harness.

## What the MCP capture establishes

`mcp-directive-call-live.jsonl` is a turn whose ONLY tool is a Crew MCP directive
tool. The server rode the `session/new` `mcpServers` array as a stdio element named
`kirocrew-core` exposing `monitor_start`; the model was a local OpenAI-compatible
stub with no credential and no network, driven to call that tool once. Three facts
come out of it, none of them inferred:

- the tool reaches the model as `kirocrew-core_monitor_start` -- server and tool
  joined by ONE underscore, where kiro-cli reports `<server>___<tool>` and the
  canonical MCP prefix form is `mcp__<server>__<tool>`;
- no `_meta.kiro` block appears anywhere in the turn, so `title` is the only
  channel that names the tool at all;
- `rawInput` is `{}` on the `tool_call` and complete on the following
  `in_progress` update, so a consumer keyed on the call's arguments can only see
  them on the refinement.

That spelling resolved to no directive tool at all before the fix:
`session_directive.directive_tool_from_call` knew `@<server>/<tool>` (KAS) and
`mcp__<server>__<tool>` (Claude), and `match_tool` splits only on a run of two or
more underscores -- so every #755 tool answered and none applied.

The capture pins how OpenCode names a mounted Crew server. Shipping code now
sends this backend its MCP array through `ACP_BACKENDS_SESSION_MCP_ARRAY`, using
the same element shape; `agent-host-contract.md` §5 describes that production
path. The remaining boundary is version-specific: this naming rule was observed
on 1.18.30, and nothing in this repository pins it across adapter upgrades.

## What the compaction capture establishes

This one is load-bearing for a MEMBERSHIP, so it is worth saying what it proves and
what it does not.

`ACP_BACKENDS_COMPACT` and `ACP_BACKENDS_INLINE_COMPACTION` both rest on one
question: does this harness finish a `/compact` inside the `session/prompt` turn,
emitting no separate status? `compact-live.jsonl` answers both halves in one slice:

```
usage_update       used=14011   (an ordinary turn)
id=3 result        stopReason=end_turn
agent_message_chunk            (the /compact turn's summary)
usage_update       used=514
id=4 result        stopReason=end_turn      <- and nothing after it
```

The ABSENCE is the evidence. No `compaction_status` frame of any kind follows the
`/compact` turn, so the turn's own terminal frame is the only done signal this
harness gives — which is why `AcpProvider.wait_for_compaction` answers from the
capability rather than waiting on the queue, and why waiting on the queue instead
would spend the whole `COMPACT_WAIT_TIMEOUT_SECS` and then recycle a session that
had just compacted correctly.

What it does not prove on its own is that the SESSION shrank rather than that one
request was smaller. A longer drive settles that: over four growing turns `used`
climbed 14863 → 15727 → 16614 → 17478, and the first ordinary turn after a
`/compact` read 14577 — below the pre-compact peak — with the model answering from
a summary of the dropped turns. That series is recorded in the pull request that
added this file rather than here, because it is six turns of filler text and carries
no frame class this corpus needs.

goose joined both sets on its own capture (`../goose/compact-live.jsonl`). pi has no
such capture and is therefore in neither set, even though its adapter source says it
compacts inline. See
`ACP_BACKENDS_COMPACT` for why source is not the bar this set holds its members to.
