"""Chat runtime sharing: who may share, which process, and the cap that bounds it.

The lease table itself is ``kiro_crew.runtime_ownership`` and is tested in
``test_runtime_ownership.py``. What is tested HERE is the three things sharing
adds on top of it: the eligibility rule, the compatibility key, and the cap that
turns a table of one-lease entries into a table of shared ones -- plus the two
places where a JOINING session must behave differently from a founding one.
