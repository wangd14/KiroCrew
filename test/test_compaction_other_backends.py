"""Compaction for the ACP backends that were outside ``ACP_BACKENDS_COMPACT``.

``test_manual_compact_gate`` and ``test_auto_compact_gate`` pin the KAS defect
and the shape of the fix.  This file pins the audit of the REST of the roster,
because "not a member" had come to mean four different things at once and only
one of them was a decision anyone had evidence for.

Three findings, one class each:

* opencode serves a manual ``/compact`` and finishes it INSIDE the
  ``session/prompt`` turn, which is a surprise twice over: it advertises no
  compaction command at all, and the earlier exclusion read that silence as the
  answer.  Driven live on opencode 1.18.30 the session's ``usage_update.used``
  climbed 14863 -> 17478 over four turns, a ``/compact`` prompt returned
  ``stopReason: end_turn`` with no status frame, and the next ordinary turn read
  14577 with the model answering from a summary.
* goose serves a manual ``/compact`` inside the turn too.  Driven live on goose
  1.50.1, ``used`` climbed 1529 -> 2453 over three turns, ``/compact`` answered
  ``Compaction complete`` and ``end_turn`` with no status frame, and the next
  ordinary turn read 1749.
* pi looks the same in SOURCE -- pi-acp 0.0.33 dispatches ``/compact`` before any
  model turn and returns the turn itself -- but it could not be driven here, so it
  does not join on the weaker evidence class.  It stays unclassified, which still
  improves on being told it self-manages.
* KAS is the one correct exclusion, and it is correct for a REASON that is now
  a membership rather than an absence: it summarizes unasked and reports it, so
  Crew's meter falls back on its own.
* deepseek compacts nowhere Crew can see -- no ``available_commands_update`` at
  all, no compaction status in its ``session/update`` vocabulary -- while
  reporting a real meter.  Declining there bounded nothing and the reply
  promised a summary that never came.

Every newly added name is resolved with ``getattr`` rather than imported at
module scope, so on a tree without the fix these FAIL on the assertion that
names the missing property instead of erroring at collection.
