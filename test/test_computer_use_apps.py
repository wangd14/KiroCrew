"""App discovery and OS-resolved identity (``computer_use/apps_macos.py``).

Two properties are pinned here, and the first is the one that makes the whole
feature work at all:

**A process-name search resolves the WRONG pid.** Reproduced live: ``pgrep -n
"Google Chrome"`` returned 47492 — a short-lived helper process that answered
``kAXErrorCannotComplete`` to every accessibility read and then exited — while the
real browser was 637. Slack's helper 1614 likewise shadowed the real 942. So
resolution must come from the CoreGraphics window list, taking the pid that owns a
visible **layer-0** window. The decoy-pid fixture below reproduces exactly that
shape, and an AST assertion pins that no name-search call is reachable from the
module's executable code.

**The identity governance is queried on is OS-resolved, never agent-supplied.**
``resolve_identity`` answers "what is this process, according to the OS"; if the
gate were fed the model's ``app`` string instead, an allow-listed
``com.apple.finder`` could be satisfied by a model claiming "finder" while the
automation drove something else entirely.

Zero native calls: ``macos_ffi.window_list`` / ``executable_path`` are
monkeypatched, so every case runs on a Linux runner.
