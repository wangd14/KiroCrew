"""The held no-follow chain walk.

Both routes are exercised here on one host. The walk itself is ordinary Python over
two platform primitives, so the by-name route is testable wherever those primitives
answer -- and on POSIX they do: ``open_entry_no_follow`` opens with ``O_NOFOLLOW`` and
``is_reparse_point_fd`` is always False. What is NOT testable off Windows is the
guarantee the held descriptors buy, because a handle that denies ``FILE_SHARE_DELETE``
is the mechanism blocking the rename a swap needs. The Windows CI shard covers that;
what these tests pin is the walk's verdict for every state a component can be in, and
that each verdict is reached without following anything.

    ``os.fstat`` does not carry one. CPython fills ``st_reparse_tag`` only on the
    path-based ``stat``/``lstat`` route, which queries ``FileAttributeTagInfo`` by name;
    the descriptor route builds its result from ``GetFileInformationByHandle``, which has
    no tag field. A classifier reading the tag there sees zero for every object and can
    only fall back to the bare ``FILE_ATTRIBUTE_REPARSE_POINT`` bit -- which Windows also
    sets on kinds that redirect NOTHING, so the fallback denies an ordinary OneDrive
    placeholder or WOF-backed file. These tests substitute both sources to pin that the
    answer comes from the handle.
