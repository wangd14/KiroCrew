"""Integration-layer fixtures: the real gateway, booted in THIS process.

This directory is the middle layer of the test pyramid. A unit test in
``test/`` builds a bare ``web.Application()`` with a handful of routes and
mocks the rest; the E2E suites (``test/test_e2e_smoke.py``, ``test/e2e/``,
``test/test_playwright_e2e.py``) spawn ``kirocrew gateway`` as a subprocess
behind ``KIROCREW_E2E=1``. Neither answers "do the real modules work when
wired together?" -- that is what a test here answers:

* the real ``GatewayOrchestrator`` boot sequence (``run()``), not a hand-copied
  subset of it, so a new boot step is covered the day it lands;
* a real ``KIROCREW_HOME`` under ``tmp_path`` -- real session store, real
  config, real memory bindings, real agent-spec directory;
* the ONLY fake is the model: ``kiro_crew.testing.fake_acp_backend`` stands in
  for ``kiro-cli`` (tests MUST NOT spawn the real one);
* the HTTP client talks to the port the gateway actually bound, on loopback,
  from the same interpreter and event loop -- so an event-loop stall in one
  request is observable from another, and a "restart" is a second boot on the
  SAME home.

Why boot through ``run()`` and not through ``_init_dashboard()`` alone: the
bugs this layer exists for live in the seams BETWEEN boot steps -- memory
preparation vs workflow init, spec scanning vs tool policy, admission vs the
resource controller. A fixture that re-implements the sequence drifts from
the real one silently.

The one thing ``run()`` does that a test cannot survive is its last line:
``_shutdown_and_exit`` ends in ``os._exit``. Everything before that line is the
REAL shutdown sequence -- the run-marker settle and clear, ``_shutdown()``, the
orphaned-session cleanup, the crew-log and event-log drains, the log-queue
drain -- and a harness that re-implemented it drifted from it one leftover
at a time. So the boot helper does not re-implement it: teardown sets
``shutdown_event`` exactly as SIGTERM would, lets ``run()`` walk its own exit
path, and intercepts only ``os._exit``, which raises :class:`HarnessExit`
carrying the exit code instead of ending the interpreter. The interception is
held while a boot is live (a ``run()`` that exits on its own mid-test must
raise, not end pytest) and pinned by
``test_boot_smoke.py::test_shutdown_and_exit_ends_in_os_exit``.

The other process-ending path a boot arms is the loop-stall watchdog's
``faulthandler.dump_traceback_later(exit=True)`` timer, which
``start_dashboard`` arms because pytest enables ``faulthandler`` in every
worker. :func:`hard_exit_timer_disabled` is held for the same window and turns
the hard timer's arm into a no-op (the soft stack-dump half stays), so a
25-second loop stall is a failing test, not a dead xdist worker.

Shape: an ``async with`` helper, not an async fixture
-----------------------------------------------------
By this repo's convention (``testing-conventions.md``, "Async tests") the boot
is an ``async with booted_gateway(home)`` block inside the test rather than an
``@pytest_asyncio.fixture``: the teardown has to AWAIT the shutdown on the
test's own loop, and the pinned pytest-asyncio does not run async fixture
teardown there. ``gateway_boot`` is the sync fixture that binds the helper to
an isolated home::

    @pytest.mark.asyncio
    async def test_x(gateway_boot):
        async with gateway_boot() as gw:
            body = await gw.get_json("/api/health", auth=False)

Opt-in
------
The layer runs only with ``KIROCREW_INTEGRATION=1`` (the ``integration`` job
in ``ci.yml`` sets it). A bare ``pytest`` collects these files and skips them:
a boot per test is too slow for the per-commit unit shards, and the Windows
shards must not pay for a POSIX signal-handler dance they do not need.

This directory is a package (``__init__.py``) so this file imports as
``integration.conftest``. The unit files import ``test/conftest.py`` by the
bare name ``conftest``; a second top-level ``conftest`` would shadow it.

The boot reaches no real channel
--------------------------------
``KiroCrewConfig.load_credentials`` merges every ``CREDENTIAL_KEYS`` name from
``os.environ``, and the orchestrator opens Slack/Discord/... transports for
any it finds. A developer with ``SLACK_APP_TOKEN`` exported would otherwise
have a TEST connect their real workspace. ``integration_home`` deletes every
recognised credential variable for the test's duration, so the boot always
sees the no-channel configuration.

One process, many homes: what a boot leaves behind, and who puts it back
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
The whole layer runs in one interpreter, and every boot is a fresh
``KIROCREW_HOME``. A production gateway is one process for one home, so
startup pins home-derived state in module globals, installs process-wide
hooks and raises process limits, and never expects any of it to change or to
be undone. Left alone, the second boot in a worker inherits the first home's
copies and the last test's residue. Four mechanisms cover it. The lists ARE
the contract, and ``test_a_second_boot_touches_only_known_module_globals`` is
the witness that keeps them honest: it diffs every loaded ``kiro_crew`` module's
globals across a second boot, so a home-derived global startup grows that is
on no list goes red there, naming itself, rather than surfacing as a
cross-home flake three tests later.

1. **Reset** by ``_reset_home_bound_globals``, before every boot and at the
   end of every teardown (normal, ``restart()``, and the exceptional exit):

   * ``dashboard.token_secret._SECRET`` -- cached token signing key, read
     from ``<home>/token_signing.key``; a stale one signs tokens the new
     home's gateway still accepts.
   * ``dashboard.token_auth._revoked_store_singleton`` -- revoked-nonce store
     pinned to the first ``config_dir()``; ``_state`` and ``_app_perms_cache``
     -- nonce and permission state for the previous gateway's tokens.
   * ``dashboard.revocation_gen._gen`` -- memoised revocation generation,
     loaded from the home's counter file.
   * ``crash_guard._CRASH_LOG`` -- crash-record path pinned to the home by
     ``install_loop_handler``.
   * ``safety_override`` singleton and the pushed yolo-policy verdict -- an
     override a test activates (``POST /api/chat/mode`` with ``yolo``) must
     not survive into the replacement gateway; queued breadcrumb writes are
     drained first so none lands after the home is gone.
   * ``config.live`` snapshot and subscriptions -- the process-global config
     watcher every point-of-use reader prefers over its own config.
   * ``autonudge._INSTANCE`` -- the process-global service reference the
     gateway publishes; stopped and cleared if ``_shutdown()`` left it.
   * ``platform.context`` active :class:`PlatformContext` and
     ``platform.bootstrap`` boot state -- config and governance the first
     boot composed; a ``restart()`` must compose its own.
   * ``embeddings`` shared embedder and model-download manager -- both pinned
     to the home's model path, and both already ship the "KIROCREW_HOME
     changes" reset this calls.
   * ``crew_log.emit`` caches and its shutdown-drain flag -- the real exit
     path drains the session log and marks the writer as draining for
     shutdown, which would keep the next boot's writer from starting.
   * ``sandbox._SHIM_ARGV_CACHE`` -- the spawn shim's resolved argv, derived
     from the boot's config and home.
   * ``image_ledger._STORE`` -- the live ``SessionMap`` the session manager
     registers as the prompt path's durable image-ledger store; a stale one
     would persist the next boot's ledgers into the previous home's map.
   * ``browser_cli.launch._warned_lifecycle_losses`` -- the warn-once set for
     browser-socket lifecycle losses; carried across boots it would silence
     the second boot's first diagnostic.
   * ``sandbox`` cgroup-counter baselines (``_SLICE_THROTTLE_PROBE_SEEN``,
     ``_SLICE_THROTTLE_EDGE_AT``, ``_SLICE_MEMHIGH_EVENTS_SEEN``,
     ``_SLICE_OOM_SEEN``) -- each is "seeded from the first read in this
     process", and a fresh process has none; a baseline carried across boots
     would let the second boot read the first one's counter climb as a live
     throttle episode.

2. **Snapshot and restore** around the boot by ``booted_gateway``, on every
   exit: the SIGINT/SIGTERM handlers ``run()`` installs; the event loop's
   exception handler ``crash_guard.install_loop_handler`` replaces; the
   ``RLIMIT_NOFILE`` soft limit ``raise_nofile_soft_limit`` raises; and the
   ``os.environ`` keys startup writes (``KIROCREW_BOUND_PORT`` /
   ``KIROCREW_BOUND_HOST``).

3. **Waited for** by ``_teardown_boot``: the memory-preparation worker is a
   THREAD behind a process-wide fence (``kiro_crew.memory_startup``) that
   ``_shutdown()`` cannot join, so teardown polls until the fence drops.

4. **Reaped** by ``_teardown_boot``: every asyncio task the boot created that
   ``_shutdown()`` did not end. Production never needs to -- ``os._exit``
   follows -- so the MCP probe, the terminal-title poller, the browser-snapshot
   pruner, the follow-up sweep and their kin keep running against a home the
   test has discarded. Teardown snapshots ``asyncio.all_tasks()`` before the
   boot, cancels every survivor the boot added, and fails the test if one
   refuses to end within ``TASK_REAP_SECS``.

A boot that times out, is cancelled, or whose ``run()`` dies reaps its own
task and runs the same teardown before the error propagates.

What this boot does NOT run
---------------------------
The only FAKE is the model. But the boot is ``GatewayOrchestrator.run()``, not
``kirocrew gateway``, and it runs with ``test_mode=True`` and ``no_crons=True``,
so these production steps are skipped here and belong to the E2E layer:

* everything ``run_gateway()`` does before it constructs the orchestrator --
  platform boot, ``_apply_slice_limits``, the agents-dir janitor, the agent
  scratch sweep, the kiro-cli log cap and the telemetry beacon;
* ``test_mode``: the kiro-cli readiness probe (``assume_kiro_ready``) and the
  policy-distribution refresher with its ceiling projection, both outbound;
* ``no_crons``: cron arming and reconciliation (jobs load, none fires).

The flags are fixed: a test that needs one of those steps is an E2E test
today, and the helper grows the flag when the first such in-tree test does.

Route coverage
--------------
Every request made through :class:`IntegrationGateway` is attributed to the
aiohttp ROUTE it resolved to (``/api/sessions/abc`` counts toward
``GET /api/sessions/{key}``). With ``KIROCREW_INTEGRATION_HITS_DIR`` set, each
pytest process writes its hit set plus the full registered-route list at
session end; ``scripts/check_integration_route_coverage.py`` unions them and
reports the share of registered routes this suite exercised. That share is
the layer's primary coverage metric (line coverage is secondary here: a route
served end-to-end proves the wiring, a line reached by a mock does not).

The dump directory must be an ABSOLUTE path OUTSIDE the repository checkout,
and the run refuses at configure time otherwise. pytest's CWD is the repo
root, so a relative value would land the dumps in the checkout -- the exact
residue the rootdir conftest exists to prevent -- and a value inside the
checkout, ignored or not, is a file the run leaves behind. CI passes
``${{ runner.temp }}``; locally use a fresh ``mktemp -d``.
