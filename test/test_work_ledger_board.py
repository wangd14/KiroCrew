"""Tests for the Crew page's masked work-ledger read (RFC Phase 4, the surfaces).

Two conductors and two workers, the shape Phase 2's own tests established, so
isolation is exercised rather than assumed. Ledgers are written through the
store's real API (``ensure_conductor`` / ``apply_conductor_action`` /
``apply_worker_report``), because the two criteria under test are both about the
shape the store actually produces.

The outstanding rule is tested twice over: once end to end against a real
unanswered question, and once as a unit against explicit timestamps. The ordering
cases (decided-then-asked-again versus asked-then-decided) need timestamps that
differ by a known sign, which back-to-back store writes cannot guarantee.
