"""Config hot-reload for the CHANNEL-BOOT area.

The claim under test is that a channel's CONNECTION parameters are applied by
restarting that one channel in process, and that nothing else about a config
reload touches a live socket:

* ``GatewayOrchestrator.__init__`` hoists each channel through its own
  ``_hoist_<channel>`` method rather than one 130-line block, and every attribute
  the channel's own boot factory consumes is still set (both halves of that
  comparison are DERIVED from the source by AST, so a dropped attribute goes
  red -- a hardcoded list would only pin a copy that goes stale);
* :meth:`GatewayOrchestrator.restart_channel` closes the previous handle,
  re-hoists from the RELOADED section and starts a new one, and the factory's
  ``dispatcher.transport`` re-point is what keeps the allow-list appliers
  pushing at the live transport instead of the closed one;
* a ``boot_keys`` path restarts the channel and any other path in the same
  section does NOT (the live appliers rely on that, or their fields would
  bounce a connection);
* the Slack applier reconciles tracked/open channels, activations and the
  phase-emoji table in place, and never restarts Slack -- its socket is
  host-managed and its tokens are not in ``config.json``;
* ``enterprise.reload_allowed_team_ids`` keeps the validated read as the sole
  source, so it cannot widen from a raw load and fails closed on a degraded one;
* ``channel_restart_required`` answers from the config SCHEMA, and the WhatsApp
  saver reports it per FIELD rather than unconditionally.

Reloads are simulated with ``live.watch().prime(cfg)`` plus a direct applier
call -- the shape a subscriber really receives. The poll task is never started.
