"""Regression tests: two agent-influenced spawns must not hand their child the
gateway's agent-denied environment.

Both halves drive the REAL production seam, not a rebuilt copy of its literals:

* ``apps/routes.py::handle_open_app`` is driven through its own HTTP route, so
  the environment under test is the one that endpoint actually builds.
* ``knowledge/llm_pool.py::CCWorker._spawn`` is driven directly, with only
  ``_claude_bin`` redirected at a stub, so every environment decision stays in
  production code.

``KIROCREW_OWNER_ID`` is the probe key at both sites: it is a member of
``sandbox._AGENT_DENIED_ENV_KEYS`` that carries no credential material of its
own, so the planted value can stay a neutral literal. The other members of that
list -- the chat-platform bot-token class, the tracker/forge token class and the
central-governance fetch header -- are live bearer credentials and are named by
class only, never set here.

Each negative assertion has a positive control beside it, because the cheap
wrong way to pass a test like this is to hand the child an environment so empty
it cannot work: a desktop launcher needs the display variables, and the
knowledge worker needs its CLI on ``PATH``, its ``HOME`` config and the provider
key the product deliberately passes to agent children.
