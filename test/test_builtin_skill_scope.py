"""Behavioural tests for scripts/check_builtin_skill_scope.py.

Local backlog f-20260818-08. Everything under ``src/kiro_crew/builtin_skills/``
installs on every machine that installs Kiro Crew, so a skill body naming THIS
repository resolves for exactly one reader and points an agent at a path that does
not exist for anyone else. ``prepare-pr`` already solved it -- repository
specifics live in a profile keyed by repository -- and this gate keeps the rest of
the tree from regressing.

The rule is absolute: no baseline, no recorded exemptions. Three properties carry
it and all three are tested rather than assumed -- the marker set must catch
repository shapes WITHOUT catching the product surface a builtin skill exists to
describe, the exemption must not be inheritable by a nested or look-alike
directory, and a file the gate cannot read must fail rather than pass.
