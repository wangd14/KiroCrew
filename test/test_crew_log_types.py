"""The per-type ``data`` registry: what it declares, and that the append path enforces it.

Three claims, and they are separate on purpose. The registry must accept every
entry a real WRITER produces (the emitter and the crash-repair closers), it must
refuse each way a payload can be wrong, and it must leave an undeclared type
alone -- which is what keeps the crew log and every guest namespace writable
while the session families are checked.
