"""Capture what every known harness is LAUNCHED as, for the golden and its writer.

Two callers import this: ``test/test_acp_launch_goldens.py``, which is strictly
read-only against the committed fixture, and
``scripts/update_acp_launch_goldens.py``, which is the only thing that writes it. The
machinery lives here rather than in the test module because a test must not create
files in the repo that outlive the run (AUTOSDE ``no-test-side-effects``), and a
regeneration hook inside a test module is exactly that.

What is captured, per backend id: the argv handed to the process factory, the label
the spawn is logged under, the label stderr is drained under, and the environment
variables the spawn ADDS to the ones it inherited. Those four are the observable
contract of the per-harness spawn arms. A change that moves where they are COMPUTED
must not move what they ARE -- for kiro-cli above all, whose construction path
harness-parity H13 keeps free of work added for an adapter.

The environment is recorded as the DELTA from ``os.environ`` rather than in full, so
the snapshot is a property of the code and not of the machine that ran it. Four
values inside that delta are placeholders for the same reason: the augmented search
path, the interpreter path, pi's per-session gate nonce and the per-session identity
token all vary per host or per run, while the FACT that the harness receives them is
what is pinned.

Every collaborator on the spawn path is stubbed to a fixed answer, including the
resolvers, the sandbox wrapper and each harness's own routing read-back. The point is
the argv and the env, so a real sandbox profile or a real read-back child would add
host dependence and prove nothing this capture asks about. A collaborator that answers
with one of its own arguments is stubbed through :func:`_stub_for`, which reads what to
accept off the live object, so this file holds no copy of a signature it does not own.
