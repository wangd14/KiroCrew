"""The capability card is a PROJECTION, and these tests are what keeps it one.

Four properties, and each one is a cost the card exists to avoid paying again:

1. **Completeness under a new harness.** A backend id that joins
   ``ACP_BACKENDS_KNOWN`` must render a whole card with NO edit to any card file.
   That is the acceptance condition for the whole design, so it is a test rather
   than a claim: ``test_a_new_backend_renders_a_complete_card_with_no_card_edit``
   injects a synthetic id and reads its card back.
2. **Completeness under a new capability set.** Every ``ACP_BACKENDS_*`` set the
   vocabulary module defines has to be classified -- user-facing, security note,
   operator note, off-card, or the membership floor. A set in none of them is a set
   nobody decided about, which is the same failure the disposition-row test in
   ``test_agent_sdk_capabilities`` catches one layer down.
3. **No per-harness prose, and no per-harness branch.** The card file may not
   compare against a backend id: the moment it does, a new harness costs an edit
   here and the projection has become a table. Membership is the allowed shape --
   ``backend in <set>`` is the whole mechanism -- so the check is scoped to
   EQUALITY against an id, which is the shape that captures one harness.
4. **The third card state is DECLARED, so the declaration is gated.** Available and
   not-available are projected; "not measured" cannot be, because no bit carries it
   -- it is ``DECLARED_UNMEASURED``, the one per-harness table in the card module.
   Three tests are what keep that exception from becoming the per-harness card this
   design exists to remove: an entry must be supported by the deciding set's OWN
   comment in the vocabulary module, it may not name a MEMBER of that set, and a
   harness the table does not name must be measured on every line.
5. **The two unions rest on a coincidence, so the coincidence is pinned.** Two
   lines read ``ACP_BACKENDS_ACP_RUNTIME`` as a stand-in for the kiro family. That
   set's own meaning is narrower (served by the shared runtime, reads the
   kiro-family ``cli.json`` overlay), and its docstring names the harness that
   would break the alignment: a multiplexer served by a demux that is not
   kiro-shaped. ``test_the_kiro_family_stand_in_still_stands_for_the_kiro_family``
   fails on that day, before the card starts claiming two capabilities such a
   harness does not have.
