"""The capability sets must be askable without importing ``kiro_crew.acp``.

Importing anything under
``kiro_crew.acp`` executes that package's ``__init__`` (client + runtime), and
``kiro_crew.acp`` is a FORBIDDEN_ROOT for the agent-SDK boundary gate -- so every
consumer outside the ACP layer that asked a capability question had to add a
forbidden edge, against a baseline that may only shrink. Onboarding a new harness
means teaching outside consumers (readiness, prerequisite, MCP wiring) to ask these
sets, so that cost was about to be paid repeatedly.

Definitions now live in the leaf :mod:`kiro_crew.agent_sdk.backends` -- moved there
from ``kiro_crew/acp_backends.py`` by RFC PR 3, which pulls the capability
mechanism inside the agent-SDK boundary -- and are re-exported from ``acp.types``
for existing importers. These tests pin both halves: the leaf stays reachable
without the ACP package, and the re-export keeps working.

``kiro_crew.acp_backends`` survives as a pure re-export shim, so both spellings
still import and both still read one registry. The definition-home test below
asserts the sets are defined in the SDK module and NOT in that shim, because a
definition left behind in the shim is a definition an outside consumer can reach
without crossing the boundary at all.
