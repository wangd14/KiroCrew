"""Member sessions get session control automatically, bounded by ownership.

The crew-member operating model — the DM thread dispatches real work into
worker sessions it creates and patrols — holds with ZERO configuration: a
member caller passes the session-control gates without the global
``agent.session_control`` opt-in, and is bounded to the workers it created
itself instead. These tests pin the three halves of that contract:

* the gate bypass (member caller passes with the switch off; an ordinary
  caller still needs it),
* the ownership boundary (a member cannot touch a slot it did not create,
  even when the global switch is ON),
* the persistence of the boundary's input (``created_by`` written at birth
  and restored on rehydrate — without it every worker a member dispatched
  would come back unowned after a restart and the fail-closed check would
  strand them).

The session_* kirocrew-dashboard tools ride this same server-side
authorization: mounting them into a member session (per-session, over the
wire) grants nothing an ordinary caller could not already reach, because
every verb terminates in these gates.
