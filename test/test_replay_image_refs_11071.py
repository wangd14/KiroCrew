"""Replayed history carries no image reference into a prompt.

A history row's picture belonged to an earlier turn, and a text vehicle cannot
carry bytes, so the reference is the only thing that would arrive. Both readings
of an arriving reference are wrong, and both are pinned below:

* the file is still readable -- a builder that inlined any readable path it
  found in the text would bring back a picture Kiro Crew's compaction already
  dropped, at full byte cost on every cold start, with the markdown mangled into
  ``![alt]([image: name])``. The builder emits image blocks only from the
  channel's structured attachment list, so a replayed path is text, never a
  block on its own; the strip stays load-bearing for the other reading;
* the file is absent -- no image block is emitted and the PATH sits in the prose,
  next to the assistant's own description of what the picture showed. That
  dangling reference is what makes a model narrate a screenshot it cannot see.

Kiro Crew's replay is the path an auto-compaction reaches. A failing in-place
``/compact`` sends ``CompactionCoordinator._recycle_held``, which pops the
session while leaving ``_suppress_replay`` alone -- ``reset(clear_conversation=
True)`` arms that flag, a recycle deliberately does not, because a recycle
preserves the conversation -- and the compact callback posts its success notice
either way. The next turn is therefore a cold start that re-injects the
transcript, and a persisted row keeps its markdown image reference by design:
the attachment store rewrites the destination into the transcript's
``.attachments/`` directory so the reference survives.

The three consumers that render persisted rows into prompt text all draw from
``_replay_rows`` / ``_recall_rows``, which is why the strip happens there.

The bare-path pass is narrower than the inliner's own ``_PATH_RE`` in two ways,
and both are pinned: code spans and URL-embedded paths keep their text, because
rewriting either is corruption rather than scrubbing.
