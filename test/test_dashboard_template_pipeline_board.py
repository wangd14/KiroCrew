"""The pipeline board CARD: the page binds exactly what the flattener writes.

``mypy src/kiro_crew/`` checks both ends of ``build_pipeline_board`` -- a
:class:`~kiro_crew.work_vocab.WorkBoardView` in, a ``PipelineBoardPanel`` out, required
keys and all. It cannot see inside ``dashboard_templates/pipeline_board.html``, so the
html end of the agreement needs a reader of its own. This is that reader.

TWO GATES, because the card format needs both and neither implies the other.

The first is PARITY, strict and in both directions: the page's
``data-dashboard-field`` set equals ``panel_card_data``'s output keys. The host binds a
field it was not given to the EMPTY STRING, so a binding with no writer is a blank cell
on a page of counts -- indistinguishable from a real zero -- and a written key nothing
binds is a value nobody sees.

The second is COVERAGE, which the drawer template's parity gate gets for free: it compares
that template's reads against the contract's own leaves, so a contract field nobody renders
fails there. A card cannot do that: it has 24 fields for 17
contract leaves whose lists are unbounded, so several leaves reach the page inside a
composed sentence rather than as a field of their own. :func:`test_every_contract_leaf_
reaches_a_card_field` closes that by SEEDING each leaf with a unique marker and requiring
it to come out the other side -- which proves the value travels, not merely that a name
matches.

Every extractor here refuses rather than returning a partial answer. A short set reads
as a page that genuinely binds less, which is the one direction an equality assertion
cannot catch alone -- so the preconditions run as their own cases.

Written with the stdlib html parser, not a regular expression. An attribute scan by
regex mis-reads an attribute inside a comment, a value in the other quote character and
an upper-case tag name, and each of those makes this gate QUIETLY incomplete.
