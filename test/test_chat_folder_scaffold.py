"""Tests for the folder-scaffold endpoints.

The scan endpoint is a preview, so what is pinned there is mostly what it does
NOT do: it creates no folder, it refuses exactly the roots manual folder
creation refuses, and it never offers to re-create a folder the user already
has. The scaffold endpoint is the half that writes, so what is pinned here is
that it writes only what the server itself just offered, nests what it creates
the way the preview showed it, and never removes anything — including the
folders a failed creation leaves behind. The scanner's own detection rules are
covered by the engine suites; the layouts below are the smallest ones that
exercise an endpoint concern.
