"""Bounded rejection writes: a stalled ACP stdin fails fast as a dead process.

A permission answer goes to the backend over its stdin pipe. ``stdin.drain()``
returns at once while the pipe has room and parks only when the writer is
flow-control paused -- the backend has stopped reading and the pipe behind it
is full. Left alone, the deny path that awaited it stayed parked until the turn
deadline cancelled the coroutine -- the audit record survives that
(test_deny_audit_first.py), but the turn hangs for its whole budget and the
recovery that a *closed* pipe already gets (``AcpProcessDied`` -> session reset
+ bounded requeue) never engages.

Both transports answer permissions: ``AcpClient`` (process per session) and the
shared ``AcpRuntime`` (the default kiro backend, one stdin for every multiplexed
session; its ``AcpRuntimeDead`` is translated to ``AcpProcessDied`` by the
session provider). These tests pin the bound on the response-frame writers of
both -- ``_send_response`` / ``_send_error`` and ``send_response`` /
``send_error``:

* a drain that never completes raises ``AcpProcessDied`` within the bound, on
  both ``reject_tool`` branches (advertised reject option / ``cancelled``
  fallback) and on the unknown-method error reply;
* the failure is logged at warning with the request id, and the id is
  ``repr``-escaped and credential-redacted so a backend-authored id can neither
  inject control characters nor leak a token into the log or the error text;
* a drain that completes is untouched: one write, one drain, ``_last_activity``
  stamped, and the broken-pipe mapping still applies;
* the bound is a NO-PROGRESS bound: a writer whose buffer keeps shrinking (a
  multi-MB prompt frame from another session draining ahead of the response on
  the shared stdin) is a live reader and is waited on past the bound; only a
  buffer that did not shrink for the whole bound is a stall. Without that, the
  shared runtime would be marked dead -- tearing down every co-tenant session --
  by an ordinary large prompt;
* every stdin write on a transport takes that transport's write lock, and the
  response write waits for the lock under the same no-progress bound. The
  buffer-size measurement is exact only with one writer in flight: a
  concurrent append would offset the bytes the reader consumed and read as
  "no progress" on a healthy backend.
