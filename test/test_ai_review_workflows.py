        An inherited `GIT_DIR` / `GIT_WORK_TREE` / `GIT_INDEX_FILE` (set by a
        hook, a wrapper, or a parent test runner) would make `git init` and
        every write below land in THAT repository despite `cwd=repo`, so every
        `GIT_*` location variable is dropped. Global and system config are
        pointed away too, so a host-wide `commit.gpgsign` or hook path cannot
        reach the fixture.

        `RUNNER_TEMP` is given its own per-case directory for the same reason,
        and it matters as soon as a step under test keeps anything there. The
        evidence step reads the PR description through pr-body-snapshot.sh,
        which caches that read under `$RUNNER_TEMP` BECAUSE a job is exactly
        the scope one read should serve. On a GitHub runner that variable is
        set job-wide, so inheriting it makes every case in the shard share one
        cache: the first case to run leaves a snapshot for `example/repo#7`,
        and every later case reuses it instead of calling its own `gh` stub --
        its call counter is never written, and a case that asks the stub to
        fail sees the step succeed. The failure is invisible off-runner, where
        `RUNNER_TEMP` is unset and each case falls back to a fresh `mktemp -d`.
        One case is one job, so one case gets one job temp.

    Each AI review is published by two workflows: the same-repo lane and the
    privileged Stage-2 ``fork-*-review.yml``. GitHub resolves a required status
    check to the NEWEST check-run of that name, and on a fork PR the same-repo
    lane reviews nothing. While the two lanes share a name, any
    ``pull_request`` event firing after the fork lane posted its verdict (a
    reopen; an ``edited`` title/body on codex-review) makes the same-repo
    lane's own run the newest one and clears the gate on a review that never
    ran. The same-repo lane therefore renames itself on a fork PR, leaving
    exactly one publisher of the protected name per PR type.

    That rename only renders because the fork guard sits on every STEP rather
    than on the job: GitHub does not evaluate a skipped job's ``name:``, so a
    job-level guard published the raw expression source as the fork PR's check
    name. The per-step gate is therefore load-bearing for the name AND the only
    thing keeping fork content out of this privileged lane, so it is asserted

    """No review lane may bury a posted verdict under an incomplete body.

    Covers every lane that upserts a marker-keyed summary comment outside
    codex-review.yml. Each lane defines the guarded upsert as a byte-identical
    ``guarded_comment_upsert`` bash function; the identity test pins every
    copy to one canonical body so the invariant cannot drift lane by lane, and
    the behavioral tests run each lane's REAL step bash with a stubbed ``gh``
    for the contract cases.

    The guarded transition is a NO-TOUCH, not a merge: a run whose body
    carries no ``"<stamp> <head>"`` proof marker leaves an existing comment
    entirely alone. Reading the body and PATCHing a merge of it back would
    reopen the same class of loss from the other side, because runs for
    different heads are not cancelled — a verdict published between the read
    and the write is restored away.

    Both fork lanes decide ``kind`` from the presence of ``[<NAME>-REVIEWED]

    stamp is absent or SHA-corrupted -- a clean review can carry a truncated
    sha -- ``kind`` falls to ``incomplete`` and the body goes only to the job
    logs behind a one-line "no verdict" notice. A reader then cannot tell a
    clean review with a mangled stamp from a review that produced nothing, and
    those need opposite responses.

    The branch prints the captured body with every marker DE-BRACKETED, which is
    what keeps this a reporting change: ``REVIEWED_STAMP_RE`` and
    ``BLOCK_MERGE_RE`` both anchor on a literal ``[``, so the surfaced body is
    inert to the parser in exactly the way an absent body is. The check-run
    conclusion is re-derived independently and still fails closed.

    Deliberately NOT surfaced: the pass-failure stub. If GPT's pass 1 fails,

    * `Read(//proc/**)` + `Read(//sys/**)` DENIED, because `Read` is path-unscoped

    * the runner's own on-disk copy of the exported credential

      is a FILE and so is covered by neither of the other two.

    Setting `allowed_non_write_users` auto-enables `claude-code-action`'s
    subprocess secret-scrub plus bubblewrap isolation, and the action bootstraps
    in two sequential network phases. First `apt-get install bubblewrap socat`:
    on the ubuntu-latest image `/etc/apt/apt-mirrors.txt` names the azure mirror
    first over plaintext http and falls back to the two canonical hosts over
    https, so all three are on the path of that one install. Then the CLI itself,
    via `curl https://claude.ai/install.sh`, whose script reads its version
    manifest and binary from `downloads.claude.ai/claude-code-releases`.

    Both phases are asserted together because they are SEQUENTIAL: an allowlist
    carrying only the apt half lets apt succeed and then dies on curl, with the
    same `review incomplete` and no model call, so a green apt phase is not
    evidence that the bootstrap resolves.

    Blocked, the install exits 7 before the model is ever reached, and the lane
    reports `review incomplete` rather than a verdict. Failing closed is
    correct -- the isolation is a security control, so running unsandboxed must
    never be a silent fallback -- but the lane then cannot review at all, and the
    advisory lanes publish that as a NEUTRAL check, so three reviewers stopped
    reviewing every fork PR without turning anything red.

    This is the whole-file guard: `workflow_run` lanes always execute the DEFAULT

# A review lane that judges the author's stated intent has two ways to get the
# description, and they are not equivalent. A grant that lets the MODEL fetch it
# leaves the verdict with no revision to name: the model picks the moment, so the
# verdict answers for whatever the text said then, and a reader cannot tell a
# current verdict from one whose description-derived finding the author has since
# corrected. A workflow step that captures it ONCE gives the verdict a single,
# nameable input, and the digest of those bytes is what the verdict carries.
#
# The grant is also a live redirect. `--allowedTools` Bash grants are
# PREFIX-matched, so `Bash(gh pr view:*)` equally admits
# `gh pr view ... > <path>`: text injected into a diff can overwrite the lane's
# own input files. These pins hold both properties at once, and they enumerate
# every workflow from disk rather than a list, so a lane added later is covered
# the day it lands.

    Two independent fetches, in adjacent steps of one job, are the hazard:

    two such reads pairs the OLD attachments with the NEW prose, and the
    manifest digest the lane publishes is taken over that pair -- a composite
    revision that never existed, which a reader recomputing it reads as a match.
    Nothing corrects it afterwards either, because the lanes fire on
    `opened, synchronize, reopened` and a description edit starts no run.

    The window was ordinary rather than adversarial: pushing a commit starts the

    The invariant, as one sentence: in any workflow that both sources a script
    from `.github/scripts/` and assumes a role, every source must appear before
    every assume. It is stated over the WHOLE file rather than per lane, because
    the reason is not local -- a session assumed once persists for every later
    step in the job, so "before the model call" is not the same bar as "before
    any credentials exist".

    On a same-repo pull request the checkout is the PR's merge ref, so a sourced
    script is the PR's own editable copy; running it after an assume executes
    PR-authored shell with Bedrock credentials in its environment. The fork lanes
    check out base_sha and so are not exposed today, but they are held to the same
    order deliberately: an exception resting on which ref a lane checks out breaks
    silently the day that ref changes, and this pin is what makes the property
    independent of it.

    `design-review.yml` documents this ordering in prose. Prose is not a gate: it
    describes an order without holding it, and an order that must hold in six
    lanes at once needs something that fails when one of them drifts. That is
