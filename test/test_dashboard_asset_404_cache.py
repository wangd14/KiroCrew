"""Regression: a 404 under ``/assets/`` must never leave with ``immutable``.

The unit tests in ``test_dashboard_security_headers.py`` feed
``_apply_security_headers`` a ``web.Response`` whose status is already final,
so they cannot see this bug: aiohttp's ``FileResponse`` (what ``add_static``
returns) is constructed with status 200 and only discovers the file is missing
inside ``prepare()`` -- AFTER every middleware has run. The middleware therefore
stamps ``public, max-age=31536000, immutable`` on what becomes a 404, and
Chromium stores that 404 for a year under the request URL. Because lucide icon
chunks keep the same content hash across releases, a 404 cached while a gateway
was mid-swap of its ``dist/`` poisons the module graph of every later bundle
that imports the same chunk: the ``<script type=module>`` fails silently and the
pane never boots. Observed on the desktop app's remote-crew panes (one origin
stuck for days while its siblings on other ports loaded fine).

These tests drive a real ``add_static`` mount through the real middleware and a
real ``TestClient`` so the headers asserted are the ones that went on the wire.
