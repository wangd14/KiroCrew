"""AWS Control backup -- the unchanged-check that stops a nightly re-uploading a copy.

Three layers, because each answers a question the others cannot:

* ``TestTreeFingerprint`` pins the MECHANISM on hand-built archives. This is where
  the "archives differ, decision does not" property lives, and where each
  normalization (the bundle's timestamped root, the manifest's ``created_at``) is
  shown to ignore exactly what it claims to and nothing more -- every exclusion gets
  a case where the value it drops is the ONLY difference, and a second case proving a
  neighbouring value still counts.
* ``TestRealBundleAssumption`` pins an ASSUMPTION about a module this one does not
  own. The skip rests on ``created_at`` being the only field ``snapshot.py`` rewrites
  on a rebuild; that is measured rather than assumed, and this builds two real
  bundles so the day a second volatile field appears CI goes red instead of the skip
  quietly never firing again.
* ``TestUnchangedBaseline`` and the two run-path classes pin the DECISION, in both
  directions. A guard that only ever refuses is indistinguishable from a feature that
  never runs, so every skip test has a sibling proving the same setup uploads when
  something really moved.
