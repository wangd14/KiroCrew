"""The packaged session-control page is pinned to ``mcp_dashboard``'s real tool surface.

``scripts/docs_lint.py`` gates a doc's links, its reachability from an index, and the
paths it cites. None of that asks the question this page's whole value rests on: does
it still describe every tool the server actually advertises? A tool added to
``_tool_definitions`` and absent from the page is a capability an agent reading the
shipped docs cannot find, and a tool the page names after the server drops it is worse
— the agent calls it and gets ``Error: unknown tool``.

So the tool-name set is asserted in BOTH directions against the live definitions
rather than against a hand-copied list, and the three claims most likely to rot
independently of any name — the argument defaults the page tabulates, the session
tools a channel agent is contained from, and the config switch that gates the whole
surface — are asserted against the code that decides them.

Deliberately NOT pinned here: the prose. A page that may only say what a test can
phrase is a page nobody improves.
