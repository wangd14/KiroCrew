"""The standing auto-approve switch lives on an UNOPENABLE keystone, not in config.json.

A read-only seal on ``config.json`` closes a write to the sealed NAME. It cannot close
the inode behind that name: the crew data-home root is writable in every sandbox, the
agent runs as the operator's uid and so OWNS the document, ``link(2)`` needs no write
permission on the file it names a second time, and a bind mount seals a MOUNT rather
than an inode. ``sandbox`` states that fact itself where it refuses a governance
ceiling whose ``st_nlink`` is not 1.

The switch therefore lives on a leaf a sandboxed process cannot OPEN. Two properties
carry that, and each gets its own assertion below because either alone is
insufficient:

* masked rather than sealed read-only -- a sealed-but-readable leaf is still a
  ``link(2)`` source;
* a DIRECTORY rather than a file -- Linux refuses ``link(2)`` on a directory outright,
  so the alias shape has no source even in principle.

Every claim has a discriminating control beside it, so a vacuous or misspelled set
cannot make this file pass.

    A grant is honoured only where the mask holding the leaf out of an agent's reach is

    cases about the mask itself state their own departure from this.

    Delegation is pinned for the same reason and not as a convenience: the mask is a Linux
    bind mount or a macOS Seatbelt profile, so on a Windows runner every one of those

    The DELEGATION PREDICATE is what gets pinned rather than ``sys.platform``, so that the

    own rendering default, whose test would go vacuous against a forced platform.
