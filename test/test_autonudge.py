    The default lives at the ARMING SURFACES (the monitor_start tool, its directive,
    the REST route), not in ``AutoNudgeService.add``. That distinction is the point
    rather than a detail: the service also arms loops whose work is NOT a pull

    message that merely mentions one PR would throttle those and, if the PR is
    already merged, deactivate them before their first turn. The surfaces' own
    defaults are pinned where they live: ``test_monitor_start_ack`` asserts the
