"""Coverage for the Playwright CLI installers (`playwright-cli.sh` / `.ps1`).

These installers are the one code path a user runs BEFORE they have a working
Node toolchain, so a failure here is unrecoverable from inside the product: the
user sees a shell error and has nothing to fall back on. CI has no shellcheck or
PowerShell lint job, and the interesting behavior — which Node build is chosen
for a platform, whether a tampered download is rejected, and which remedy an
enterprise-network failure prints — cannot be reviewed by reading either script.

Everything here is hermetic. `node`, `npm` and `curl` are stubs on a PATH the
test controls, `HOME` and `KIROCREW_HOME` point into `tmp_path`, and no test
reaches the network or writes outside its own temp dir.
