"""Liveness tests for the shell-command gate.

``is_sensitive_bash_command`` runs synchronously on the gateway's event loop,
under a loop-stall watchdog that hard-exits the process after 25 s of silence
(``dashboard.loop_stall_exit_after_secs``). Path-matching passes over the command
are quadratic, so a ~9 KB command full of ``https://`` URLs can stall the loop
past that budget. The gate does not match paths in command text at all -- and
what it still runs
(the size ceiling, the IMDS detector and the environment-credential detector) is
pinned here at the crash size, under the ceiling, where it is what the loop
actually pays. The ceiling itself is pinned as a refusal, not a skip: a command
too long to scan is denied rather than let through unscanned.

# Package shape: the split must not grow back into a monolith
# ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────


#: Ceiling on the whole security PACKAGE, not on any one file in it. The controls
#: were one module of about 21,800 lines, and the split adds a re-export block, an
#: export manifest and the mirroring facade on top of the code it relocates, so the
#: budget is that size plus room for the machinery, plus the redaction record,
#: credential-source and allowed-host modules, plus the resolver child script
#: (``_child_realpath.py``, ~190 lines) that lives beside the resolver it serves
#: rather than in the pool package. It is a bound on total volume: relocating a
#: declaration between submodules moves nothing across it.
#:
#: Raised again, from 27,200, when the facade stopped binding re-exported names
#: eagerly and began resolving each through its owner. That trades one import block
#: for two name lists -- an owner table and a ``TYPE_CHECKING`` block, one line per
#: exported name in each -- which measured 618 lines at the current surface and is
#: machinery, not control logic.
#:
#: Raised again, from 27,751, for the write-protected home entries covering the MCP
#: launch-approval directory and ``mcp/resolved``: gatewayd spawns an approved stub's
#: backend outside the sandbox, so a session must not be able to write either path.
#:
#: Raised again, from 27,761, for the ssh self-target refusal note: it says how long
#: a retry can still land inside the background check and names the IP-literal case
#: where this machine's address list cannot be read, so a refused agent knows when
#: to stop retrying and what to use instead.
#:
#: Raised again, from 27,766, for the write-protected home entry covering the kiro-cli
#: global MCP registry (``~/.kiro/settings/mcp.json``) and its ``KIRO_HOME``
#: re-anchoring: an ``autoApprove`` on an entry there is honoured by default and skips
#: the tool gate entirely, while the entry that decides it is admitted on its name
#: shape rather than on who wrote the file -- so an agent-writable registry grants its
#: own verbs a standing bypass. The reasoning for one leaf is most of the cost, which
#: is the shape every entry on this tier has.
#:
#: Raised again, from 27,814, for resolving the ``$HOME``-rooted form of both kiro-cli
#: write-tier leaves rather than only their ``KIRO_HOME`` copies. Anchoring them
#: lexically covered a symlinked ``$HOME`` itself but not one further down the path, so
#: a dotfile-managed ``~/.kiro`` left the real spec dir and the real MCP registry outside
#: the fence while their ``~``-spelled paths stayed inside it. The cost is the reasoning
#: plus one shared tuple, which is what replaces a second per-leaf arm.
#:
#: Lowered to 27,851 by SUBTRACTION. An earlier revision of this branch also emitted
#: every kiro-cli target in a second, all-forward-slash spelling, on the premise that a
#: Windows root could reach the anchor builder carrying the operator's own separators.
#: That premise is false: every root arrives through ``_resolve_root_anchors``, which
#: returns ``_realpath_or_none(expanded) or _lexical_root(expanded)``, and both answer
#: in the native spelling -- ``_lexical_root``'s ``os.path.normpath`` converts
#: ``C:/Users/x`` to ``C:\Users\x``. With no input that fails without it, the second
#: spelling was decoration, and on POSIX it would fence a bogus neighbour for any file
#: whose name contains a backslash. It is removed together with the two tests that
#: existed only for it; the ``$HOME``-symlink coverage passes without it, which is what
#: shows it was never load-bearing.
#:
#: Raised again, from 27,851, because the ``KIRO_HOME`` half was two hardcoded
#: per-leaf arms while the ``$HOME`` half looped the tuple -- so the tuple's own
#: comment ("a third leaf joins both halves by landing here") was false, and a third
#: leaf would have been fenced under ``$HOME`` and writable under the override. Both
#: halves now loop the same tuple, each leaf's tail is spelled once, and a test adds a
#: probe leaf and asserts BOTH spellings refuse -- it fails on the old code.
#:
#: Re-pinned again, on top of every raise above, for the ``panel-dismissals`` leaf
#: added to ``_CREW_SECRET_LEAVES`` in ``paths.py``: one entry plus the comment
#: stating why nothing a run can reach may forge or delete the operator's dismissal
#: records. Ten lines, all of them the fence declaration and its reason -- no new
#: control logic and no new matching pass. This branch's raise and the ones above it
#: are independent additions to the same ratchet, so the number below is re-MEASURED
#: off the tree rather than being the arithmetic sum of the deltas.
#: Raised again, from 27,863, for the own-address startup warm in ``argv_floor``:
#: the gateway starts the netlink read at boot, the worker reads and publishes that
#: table before any DNS lookup, and the publish merges the addresses and opens the
#: IP-literal window in one lock hold while each check reads the window flag before
#: the names, so the first ssh after a restart is not refused as this machine and a
#: secondary own IP is never admitted mid-publish. A dump that ends without
#: NLMSG_DONE, or that the kernel flags NLM_F_DUMP_INTR, counts as unread, so a
#: partial table never opens the window. So does an NLMSG_DONE whose errno is not 0.
#: Three incomplete dumps in a row log one warning, so a host whose table never
#: reads can be told apart from a target that is really this machine.
#: Re-pinned again, from 27,942, for the assignment resolver's whole-script walk in
#: ``shell_normalizer.py``: command-boundary, quoted-separator, bounded ``eval``-join,
#: per-choice guarded-reassignment readings enumerated exactly per co-referenced
#: group (fail-closed past the group cap and the volume budget), one reading per
#: token list, ``|&`` and glued-name binding rules, one reading budget per
#: command, quotes read as syntax only in a quoted whole script, the append
#: form co-referenced, a verb binding live inside a script, each reading charged
#: at its own size, an append read as a leading assignment, compound-command
#: keywords and ``case`` patterns as guards, a guarded append as a choice, one
#: reading budget per payload WALK, an assignment-shaped argument as a choice, an
#: append inside a script read onto the outer value, a pipe joining its sides in
#: the grouping and in a further reading, the fail-closed reading a marker every
#: consuming floor refuses on rather than the mint spelling, a glued pipe read as
#: the operator it spells, every guard its own choice (two guards spelled alike
#: are not one test in case-folded text), a compound body's guard sticky over every
#: statement in it, ``$IFS`` a separator in an expanded use, and a word glued to a
#: ``case`` pattern's ``)`` or a function's ``{`` its own word, and the
#: glued first name's suffix reading serving a use only (a closer glued inside a
#: quoted argument closing nothing), and the FIRST assignment's name glued via
#: ``_SHELL_ASSIGN_RE`` before append handling so a long glued ``name+=<cli>``
#: carrier records under the name its use reads (GPT F1), and an append
#: continuing the assignment run so a command-word-less run's binding is not
#: read as prefix-scoped, and an expansion's inner operator masked before the
#: co-reference split (with the ``$`` test a fast path, not a boundary skip) so
#: two names across it stay one group, and an over-cap guarded group fail-closed BY
#: CONSTRUCTION -- folded to allowed only when every command word is a benign
#: allowlisted program (or a read-only git) and every operand is inert, so a gap in
#: the allowlist can only over-refuse and never bypass a floor, with a subshell-scoped
#: APPEND read at the command-run end rather than the next token (invert-default found
#: in review, +62 lines: the base allowlist vocabulary and the fold's inert command
#: test), 1128 lines measured -- then the four bypasses the reviewer proved on that
#: fold closed (the full co-referenced group at the call site, rsync gated on a
#: remote host:path, a use inside an assignment value co-referenced, and the line
#: pre-resolver deferring a reassigned name to the guarded resolver), +69 lines net
#: after moving ``_next_stop_indexes`` to the leaf to hold the normalizer at its cap;
#: then the line resolver's deferral regression fixed -- the ssh-family probe gate
#: reads the FULL substitution while only the resolver text defers a reassigned name
#: (38 of them the header
#: of ``shell_assignment_syntax.py``, split out of the normalizer at the per-module
#: cap below) -- the same kind of raise the resolver child script made.
#:
#: The number IS the package's measured total, carrying no spare room: a ratchet with
#: headroom admits exactly the unreviewed growth it exists to catch, so the next line
#: added here fails this gate and has to be re-pinned deliberately, with its reason
#: written above. The guards that detect a monolith growing back are the per-file cap
#: and the facade's share below, and both must stay untouched.
