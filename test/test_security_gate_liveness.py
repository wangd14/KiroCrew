"""Liveness tests for the shell-command gate.

``is_sensitive_bash_command`` runs synchronously on the gateway's event loop,
under a loop-stall watchdog that hard-exits the process after 25 s of silence
(``dashboard.loop_stall_exit_after_secs``). Path-matching passes over the command
are quadratic, so a ~9 KB command full of ``https://`` URLs can stall the loop
past that budget. The gate does not match paths in command text at all -- and
what it still runs
(the size ceiling, the IMDS detector and the environment-credential detector) is
pinned here at the crash size, under the ceiling, where it is what the loop
actually pays. The ceiling itself is pinned as a refusal, not a skip: a command
too long to scan is denied rather than let through unscanned.

# Package shape: the split must not grow back into a monolith
# ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────


#: Ceiling on the whole security PACKAGE, not on any one file in it. The controls
#: were one module of about 21,800 lines, and the split adds a re-export block, an
#: export manifest and the mirroring facade on top of the code it relocates, so the
#: budget is that size plus room for the machinery, plus the redaction record,
#: credential-source and allowed-host modules, plus the resolver child script
#: (``_child_realpath.py``, ~190 lines) that lives beside the resolver it serves
#: rather than in the pool package. It is a bound on total volume:
#: relocating a declaration between submodules moves nothing across it.
#:
#: Raised again, from 27,200, when the facade stopped binding re-exported names
#: eagerly and began resolving each through its owner. That trades one import block
#: for two name lists -- an owner table and a ``TYPE_CHECKING`` block, one line per
#: exported name in each -- which measured 618 lines at the current surface and is
#: machinery, not control logic.
#:
#: Raised again, from 27,751, for the write-protected home entries covering the MCP
#: launch-approval directory and ``mcp/resolved``: gatewayd spawns an approved stub's
#: backend outside the sandbox, so a session must not be able to write either path.
#:
#: Raised again, from 27,761, for the ssh self-target refusal note: it says how long
#: a retry can still land inside the background check and names the IP-literal case
#: where this machine's address list cannot be read, so a refused agent knows when
#: to stop retrying and what to use instead.
#:
#: Raised again, from 27,766, for the write-protected home entry covering the kiro-cli
#: global MCP registry (``~/.kiro/settings/mcp.json``) and its ``KIRO_HOME``
#: re-anchoring: an ``autoApprove`` on an entry there is honoured by default and skips
#: the tool gate entirely, while the entry that decides it is admitted on its name
#: shape rather than on who wrote the file -- so an agent-writable registry grants its
#: own verbs a standing bypass. The reasoning for one leaf is most of the cost, which
#: is the shape every entry on this tier has.
#:
#: Raised again, from 27,814, for resolving the ``$HOME``-rooted form of both kiro-cli
#: write-tier leaves rather than only their ``KIRO_HOME`` copies. Anchoring them
#: lexically covered a symlinked ``$HOME`` itself but not one further down the path, so
#: a dotfile-managed ``~/.kiro`` left the real spec dir and the real MCP registry outside
#: the fence while their ``~``-spelled paths stayed inside it. The cost is the reasoning
#: plus one shared tuple, which is what replaces a second per-leaf arm.
#:
#: Lowered to 27,851 by SUBTRACTION. An earlier revision of this branch also emitted
#: every kiro-cli target in a second, all-forward-slash spelling, on the premise that a
#: Windows root could reach the anchor builder carrying the operator's own separators.
#: That premise is false: every root arrives through ``_resolve_root_anchors``, which
#: returns ``_realpath_or_none(expanded) or _lexical_root(expanded)``, and both answer
#: in the native spelling -- ``_lexical_root``'s ``os.path.normpath`` converts
#: ``C:/Users/x`` to ``C:\Users\x``. With no input that fails without it, the second
#: spelling was decoration, and on POSIX it would fence a bogus neighbour for any file
#: whose name contains a backslash. It is removed together with the two tests that
#: existed only for it; the ``$HOME``-symlink coverage passes without it, which is what
#: shows it was never load-bearing.
#:
#: Raised again, from 27,851, because the ``KIRO_HOME`` half was two hardcoded
#: per-leaf arms while the ``$HOME`` half looped the tuple -- so the tuple's own
#: comment ("a third leaf joins both halves by landing here") was false, and a third
#: leaf would have been fenced under ``$HOME`` and writable under the override. Both
#: halves now loop the same tuple, each leaf's tail is spelled once, and a test adds a
#: probe leaf and asserts BOTH spellings refuse -- it fails on the old code.
#:
#: Re-pinned again, on top of every raise above, for the ``panel-dismissals`` leaf
#: added to ``_CREW_SECRET_LEAVES`` in ``paths.py``: one entry plus the comment
#: stating why nothing a run can reach may forge or delete the operator's dismissal
#: records. Ten lines, all of them the fence declaration and its reason -- no new
#: control logic and no new matching pass. This branch's raise and the ones above it
#: are independent additions to the same ratchet, so the number below is re-MEASURED
#: off the tree rather than being the arithmetic sum of the deltas.
#: Raised again, from 27,863, for the own-address startup warm in ``argv_floor``:
#: the gateway starts the netlink read at boot, the worker reads and publishes that
#: table before any DNS lookup, and the publish merges the addresses and opens the
#: IP-literal window in one lock hold while each check reads the window flag before
#: the names, so the first ssh after a restart is not refused as this machine and a
#: secondary own IP is never admitted mid-publish. A dump that ends without
#: NLMSG_DONE, or that the kernel flags NLM_F_DUMP_INTR, counts as unread, so a
#: partial table never opens the window. So does an NLMSG_DONE whose errno is not 0.
#: Three incomplete dumps in a row log one warning, so a host whose table never
#: reads can be told apart from a target that is really this machine.
#:
#:
#: Raised again, from 27,942, for the case-aware substitution-depth walker
#: (``_SubstitutionDepth`` over a stack of ``_Frame`` command lists, ~380 lines) that
#: every argv window bounds itself with in place of the bare paren counter -- one
#: character pass per token, no recursion, so a long clause run cannot raise out of
#: the gate; a substitution inside a ``case`` pattern is a frame of its own, so a
#: nested case's ``)`` closes nothing of the enclosing one; its ``grammar_next`` tells
#: the ssh-family walk that a case WORD, ``in`` or PATTERN is not an operand (a ``*)``
#: pattern read as every self host).  Its ``words`` lists the top-level argument
#: words a token completed with the substitutions cut out (the verb glued to a
#: closer, ``esac)<verb>``), and a DATA token (a redirection) opens a substitution
#: the window then reads through without ending it.
#:
#: Raised again, from 28,302, for the walker's lookahead: ``esac)`` in PATTERN
#: position is either the reserved word glued to the substitution's closer or a
#: quoted ``'esac')`` pattern with a clause body, and the rest of the argv settles it
#: (a ``)`` closing nothing, a ``;;`` with no case or ``esac`` in command position is
#: not valid bash under the closer reading).  One lookahead covers every ambiguity
#: up to the event it finds, so the pass stays linear.  The ssh-family walk reads a
#: substitution's body words as that command's argv, not its own operands.
#:
#: Raised again, from 28,435, for the quoted-grammar-word mark: bash reads ``case``,
#: ``esac``, ``in`` and the keepers as grammar only when no character is quoted, and
#: the tokenizer drops the quotes, so ``_self_tokens`` marks a quoted spelling from
#: the raw text (one quote-state pass) and the walker reads an argument -- a
#: ``$("case" x in y) <host>`` closes at its ``)`` and the host is this command's.
#:
#: Raised again, from 28,544, for the ssh-family walk reading the TOP-LEVEL words a
#: token completes even when the token is grammar or a whole top-level word: the
#: host glued behind a substitution's closer (``esac)<host>``, ``$(true)<host>``) is
#: the destination when the output is empty.
#:
#: Raised again, from 28,566, for the walker's reading of a QUOTED blank: at top
#: level it is text of the one word bash hands over (``'psql -h localhost'`` is one
#: ssh argument, not a host); before a fresh pattern inside a substitution it is the
#: separator the multi-token spelling gets from the tokenizer.
#:
#: Raised again, from 28,580, for the quoted-backtick mark (a single-quoted or escaped
#: backtick is text, not a substitution the walker leaves open), the walker's plain-word
#: fast path and one CLI operand reading per (frame, anchor) shared by the five
#: self-subcommand specs -- a long argv of anchors read the rest of itself five times.
#:
#: Re-pinned from 28,664 for R19: a subcommand spec's operand reading stops at its
#: leading words (the per-frame cache of full readings is gone -- it retained the
#: quadratic result), a lookahead stops at the first root event and is reused up to
#: it, the operand cache skips long tokens, a closed substitution in the ssh
#: destination slot consumes it, and the ssh floor's outer walker reads every token.
#: The quoted-text marks and their raw-text pass move to ``quoted_marks.py``, which
#: keeps ``shell_normalizer.py`` under the per-module cap it had reached.  The ANSI-C body
#: (``$'…'``) is compared decoded, as the tokenizer reads it (R20).  The ssh destination slot
#: is consumed when its substitution closes on a LATER token as well (R20 Opus).  A QUOTED
#: blank is marked as one word's text unless its quote encloses a substitution (R22).  The closer
#: reading's word behind an ``esac)`` read as a pattern is checked too, and a resolver
#: splices a grammar word in marked (R22 Opus).  Quoting restarts inside a substitution
#: met inside double quotes, and a quoted ``>``/``<`` is marked as text (R23).  Every expansion
#: spelling of the local resolver splices a grammar word in marked (R23 Opus).  An option word
#: glued behind a substitution's closer sets the ssh option state (R24 GPT).  A quoted tab or
#: newline is one word's text like a quoted blank (R25 GPT).  A quoted substitution's closer
#: is found by a quote-aware scan, so a nested quote does not end the enclosing one (R25 Opus).  Only a
#: command-position ``case`` defers that closer (R26 GPT).  The walker's words keep their
#: marks so the ssh floor can tell a quoted backtick from a substitution (R26 scope).  The
#: first quoted opener with no closer ahead ends the probing for the whole line (R27 Opus).
#: The keeper table moves to ``quoted_marks`` so the closer scan reads command position as
#: the walker does: a keeper or an option word holds it (``time -p case``, R28 GPT).  The
#: closer reading behind an ``esac)`` the lookahead settled as a pattern lists ALL its words
#: up to the refusing event, a sequence of its own: an enclosing clause's ``;;`` makes that
#: reading bash's (R28 Opus).  The closer scan hands command position on through the NAME
#: after ``function``/``coproc``, as the walker does (``function f case``, R29 GPT).  An option
#: VALUE keeps its quoted backtick for the ProxyCommand hint; a case-aware probe that reads
#: to the end turns the later openers' probes plain; a spliced FRAGMENT of a grammar word is
#: marked; a RAW blank after a fresh ``esac`` makes it the reserved word (R30 Opus), a quoted
#: one is the pattern's text (R31 GPT).  A typed mark byte is dropped at the gate's entry
#: (``strip_marks``), and a ``${`` closes only when a ``}`` AND an unmatched ``)`` stand ahead of
#: that occurrence (``BraceCloses``, R31 Opus), built lazily and shared across the anchors of
#: one argv; the mint window skips an anchor whose window an earlier walk read (R32 GPT).  The
#: closer scan escapes through an ANSI-C body and the enclosing quote pops at or past its
#: recorded closer, so both readings agree on where a quoted substitution ends (R32 Opus).  A
#: ``#`` word inside a substitution is a comment to the newline: its ``)`` closes nothing (R35 GPT),
#: and the comment is dropped from the RAW text, where the newline still stands, so a ``;`` typed
#: inside it is not the newline sentinel (``strip_comments``, R37 GPT).  The glued-option reader
#: also returns the rsync remote-shell and ssh forward readings (R37 Opus).  The comment scan keeps
#: the backtick state: only an OPENING backtick starts a word (R38 GPT).  The glued branches run the
#: detached branch's in-token remote-shell and forward checks (``_glued_option_dials_self``, R38 Opus).
