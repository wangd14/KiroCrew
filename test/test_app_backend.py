    probe clears the partially published singleton before propagating the error.

def _sandbox_can_spawn() -> bool:
    """True if the OS sandbox can launch a surviving child on this host.

    start_app_backend() fail-closes to None when the sandbox launcher can't
    start — e.g. GitHub hosted runners allow unshare(NEWUSER) but deny the
    launcher's separate unshare(NEWNS) (errno 1). sandbox._probe_unshare() used
    to give a false positive there because it issued NEWUSER|NEWNS in a SINGLE
    unshare call, which the kernel satisfies atomically; the probe now mirrors
    the launcher's split sequence, so detect_backend() reports such hosts
    honestly. This gate still runs the production path rather than trusting any
    probe: a spawn can fail for reasons a capability probe cannot see, and
    reusing wrap_argv() means this check can never drift from
    start_app_backend().

    The probe runs under an EMPTY ``KIROCREW_HOME``. It is evaluated at
    collection, before the per-test isolation fixture pins the data home, so a
    bare ``wrap_argv()`` here reads the OPERATOR's real ``~/.kiro/crew/config.json``
    -- and on a Windows or macOS developer machine that file routinely carries
    ``agent.sandbox_allow_unsandboxed_exec=true`` (the only way Kiro Crew runs
    there). That made the probe answer "can spawn" for a host with no sandbox
    backend at all, and every test it gates then failed closed under the
    fixture's default config, while CI (no operator config) skipped them. The
    gate must observe what the tests will observe: the default config.

    The probe also OWNS the Security Event Log ``wrap_argv()`` writes to. On a
    host with no sandbox backend the call fail-closes and records a ``denied``
    audit through ``sel()`` -- a process SINGLETON whose ``_dir`` is bound once,
    here from ``empty_home``. Left to construct itself that instance would be
    ASYNC, and (a) its writer thread keeps the chain lock / log open long enough
    on Windows that ``TemporaryDirectory`` cannot remove ``empty_home`` -- the
    failure lands in the bare ``except`` below and the directory leaks at the
    TEMP root, one per xdist worker, holding a ``security_events.jsonl`` and a
    ``trust/sel_hmac.key`` -- and (b) it outlives the probe: the rootdir
    ``_isolate_sel_default_dir`` floor only resets the singleton at the first
    test's setup, and any write on the lingering thread ``mkdir``s the deleted
    home back into existence. MEASURED: five full runs each left ten such
    directories. So the probe constructs the singleton itself, ``sync=True``
    (inline writes, no thread), and clears it before the directory goes.
