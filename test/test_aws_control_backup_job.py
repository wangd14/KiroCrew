"""AWS Control backups as durable Job SDK runs.

The route claims a server-owned run and returns its id, and the browser follows
it on the shared ``_jobs`` surface. Because the run is server-owned, "a backup of
mine is running" survives a reload or a navigation instead of living only in the
React component that started it and dying with it while the work keeps going.

The cases here are the ones that shape the design rather than merely cover it:

* the route claims and returns, and does NOT perform the backup itself;
* the runner is a plain ``def``, because ``JobSDK._execute`` discards its return
  value and an ``async def`` would therefore record ``done`` for a backup that
  never ran;
* the runner reads its account back out of its own record's ``dedupe_key``,
  which is the only channel P1 offers -- so the two keys the GENERIC start route
  can produce that this app's pre-flight would have rejected (absent, and not an
  account id) must fail with a clean recorded error and touch no AWS;
* a run left non-terminal by a process that is gone comes back RESOLVED, never
  ``running`` (``job_sdk.py:768``);
* the app's own terminal ledger -- what a backup PRODUCED -- still works.
