"""Tests for the session-directive protocol and forgery gate.

``session_directive`` is the stateless wire format the session-bound MCP
tools use in the gateway-off topology: the tool validates its arguments and
returns a human confirmation plus a machine marker carrying the validated
payload (never a session key). The session-aware consumer decodes the marker
and applies the effect against its OWN ``slot.key``. These tests pin the
encode/decode round-trip, the marker-stripping shown in the transcript, the
``match_tool`` name normalization, and — most importantly — the forgery gate
that makes subagent isolation structural rather than cryptographic.
