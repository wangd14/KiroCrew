"""The seam that lets one channel's queue drain wake another channel's.

Under ``messaging.dm_scope = "unified"`` one queue holds entries from several
transports: every DM dispatcher is built with the orchestrator's single
``SessionManager``, and ``build_dm_session_key`` reduces a direct chat's bucket to
``unified:{agent}``, dropping the CHANNEL as well as the user. A drain can only answer
the entries its own channel recorded, so it sets the others aside -- and because those
were already accepted and receipted, something has to come back for them.

Covered here: the registry's own rules (who is woken, who is skipped, what a raising
drain costs), the cascade terminating, and the two dispatchers driving each other end
to end through a genuinely shared queue.
