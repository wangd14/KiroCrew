"""Threads: an ordinary session anchored to one message (``dashboard/chat_threads.py``).

Two halves, and they are tested for different reasons.

The STORE half is the version-1 hardening, retargeted at the anchor index: the
sidecar is still a file beside a transcript under the data home, so every rule
that made a reply durable-or-refused makes an anchor durable-or-refused, and the
link/oversize/torn-file refusals are unchanged. Those tests are the ones that
must not weaken.

The OPEN half is new behaviour and replaces version 1's turn tests wholesale.
There is no envelope, no read-only spec, no one-reply lock and no clipping to
assert, because a thread runs its own ordinary turns; what there is to assert is
that opening mints a real session, records the anchor on BOTH sides, seeds it
once, and never touches the parent's running turn.

Uses ``async with _client()`` inside each test rather than an async-gen fixture:
the CI-pinned ``pytest-asyncio`` is incompatible with the pinned ``pytest`` for
async fixtures (see test_denied_commands_api.py docstring).
