"""``project_dir`` on the folder routes and tools, driven through the REAL routes.

``test_mcp_dashboard_folders.py`` patches the HTTP helpers and pins the tools'
call shapes. This module observes the other half -- what the routes and the
read side actually do -- by wiring ``mcp_dashboard``'s ``_get`` / ``_post`` /
``_patch`` to a live aiohttp test server running ``chat_folders``' own handlers
over a real ``DashboardState``, then reading the store the routes wrote. The
slot-create route is included so the inheritance a binding exists for is
observed end to end: a folder the person bound is one a session created inside
it inherits from, and a binding reaches every chat filed beneath it, as it
always did.

The tool is synchronous (it is a stdio MCP server), so it runs on a worker
thread while the bridge hands each request back to the test's event loop with
``run_coroutine_threadsafe`` — the same request/response contract
``mcp_core._send`` presents (a 2xx body verbatim; a 4xx collapsed to
``{"error", "code"}``).

    UNC-shaped value from a NON-PERSON principal is refused lexically, before
    the first filesystem call, through the repo's one UNC helper

    the gateway onto a host of the caller's choosing, so the person's request
