"""AWS Control backup/costs — the paths the P0 suite's backup classes leave uncovered.

``test_aws_control_app.py`` already pins the security-critical traversal (symlink
and junction refusals, descriptor-pinned descent, FIFO/O_NONBLOCK non-hang, the
restore staging checks, the teardown stop gate, and the corrupt-state shape
guards). This file covers what those do not exercise: the two whole-run push
paths (``run_snapshot_backup`` / ``run_sessions_backup``) with ``_authorize_upload``
fully mocked, the ``_authorize_upload`` account-mismatch and consent branches, the
name-based archive fallback that only Windows runs at runtime, ``list_remote_backups``,
the ``restore_download`` resolve-outside-storage guard, ``due_for_nightly``'s
malformed-timestamp branch, and the ``costs`` cache read/freshness branches.

Every fixture that touches the filesystem stays inside ``tmp_path`` so nothing
escapes into the real data home; the two run paths mock the S3 ``put_file`` and
the authorization so no network or live STS is ever reached.

        ``_record_run_locked``'s mutate writes the run record into the ``runs`` slot
        under the supersession guard and clears the failure count under that same
        guard, because the two answer one question: a record this document has already
        superseded is not evidence of anything, so it must not retire a count a later
        failure legitimately accumulated. :func:`_merge_pending` states that reason at
        the other place a run record and this clear travel together.

        Gating the clear or leaving it ungated produces identical state everywhere but
        one window, which is why no other case in the suite tells the two apart: the
        winner clears the backoff in its own mutate, so a failure has to land BETWEEN
        the winner's commit and the loser's for the loser to be the one that meets it.

        Reaching that window takes the witness as well. ``record_nightly_failure``
        compares the run slot against the witness read before its attempt, so a failure
        whose witness predates the winner's commit is refused and writes nothing. The
        witness here is therefore read AFTER the winner commits, and the row is asserted

        contender can publish before the hold exists; before that it ran in
        ``_record_run_locked``'s ``except OSError``, after the lock was released,
        and this assertion then depended on scheduling.

        ``held`` is the handshake that positions the second write after that
        registration, which is the ordering this test's final assertion depends on.
        Gating instead on the second thread's own start states only that the thread
        is running, which leaves the ordering to the machine. With the hand-off
        inside the lock the handshake is redundant, and it is kept so this test
        does not depend on where the hold is taken. The window a released lock used
        to leave is
        :meth:`test_a_contender_cannot_publish_between_a_failed_write_and_its_hold`'s
        subject; here it is excluded.

        The two runs are still genuinely concurrent -- the contender is submitted
        while the failed writer is parked, and both take their sequence from
        ``_run_lock`` -- but nothing here asserts anything about the two contending
        for the file lock, which is why gating the second one costs no coverage. That
        contention is
        :meth:`TestSessionsArchiveLayerBGate.test_a_long_holder_does_not_refuse_a_waiting_contender`'s
        subject, and single-threaded recovery ordering is
        :meth:`test_a_later_successful_write_takes_over_from_memory`'s.

        #     records the run first, and only AFTER the first `_record_run` has
        #     returned (lock released) does the test drive the second run in. The
        #     second's `_merge_pending` reads the held first run, so both uploads land.

    """The snapshot path stops where it cannot prove the bytes it would upload.

    Both backup kinds now stop where the upload body cannot be held unrewritable.
    The snapshot payload is written and closed BY NAME by ``snapshot_main`` and
    ``snapshot.prepare_redacted_copy`` before this module can open it; the archive
    produces its own body into a nameless O_TMPFILE inode. Either way, on POSIX the
    hold is real only when the sandbox mask removes the same-user writer -- a
    nameless inode is still reachable through ``/proc/<pid>/fd`` by a writer the mask
    has not excluded, and macOS/BSD can express no hold at all. Where the mask is
    absent every check available afterwards passes for a same-user replacement, and
    the fingerprint and the upload then read the substituted file and agree.

    So that platform refuses instead of uploading. These tests pin the refusal where
    it matters -- that it happens BEFORE a payload exists and that the reason is
    stated up front -- by driving the capability predicate rather than the platform,
    so the behaviour is measurable on any host.
