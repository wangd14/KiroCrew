"""Folder ``steering_dirs``: validation, accumulative inheritance, PATCH clears.

A chat folder may carry extra steering directories loaded for every chat in its
subtree. They validate per directory like ``project_dir`` (absolute, existing,
not sensitive) plus a list cap and no duplicates, resolve ACCUMULATIVELY up the
``parent_id`` chain (unlike the nearest-wins project resolver), and a PATCH with
an empty list clears them.
