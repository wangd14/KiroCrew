"""Ownership on the chat-folder tree-shaping endpoints.

A folder created by an app carries it in ``owner_app``; an absent key reads as
the person's, which is what makes this a field addition rather than a migration.
An app may create at the top level or inside a folder it owns, and may rename,
reparent or delete only what it owns. The person is never confined.

The scope is derived from the authenticated calling session, never the body: the
managed MCP set authenticates with the internal secret, which carries no app
claim, so an app agent's tool call arrives with ``request["app"]`` empty.

    Filing is how a session acquires a folder's binding and steering, so every
    place that writes ``<slot>.folder_id`` or ``<slot>.project`` is one of two
    things: a REQUEST-DRIVEN writer, which must go through the one filing
    decision (``refuse_filing_across_inheritance`` on a route,
    ``filing_crosses_inheritance`` behind the agent tools' own gate) or the
    project fences the routes already carry; or a writer that places a session
    from the gateway's own configuration, a restore, a copy or an admitted
    filing's consequence -- enumerated here with the reason, so a new writer
    lands on this test before it lands on the fences. Found by AST over the
    dashboard package, attributed to the top-level function; the inventory
    below is the whole population on the head this class was written against.
