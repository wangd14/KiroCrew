# --- writing a fixture that has to be LONG --------------------------------- #
#
# A bound in this module is a bound on retained state, so reaching one costs as
# many entries as the bound itself, and the largest fixture here runs past 2048
# entries. One ``append`` per entry is one cross-process lock,
# one tail scan and one ``os.fsync`` EACH, which measures 76-90 ms per entry on
# the Windows CI runner: that puts a 2049-entry fixture at 156-185 s against a
# 180 s per-test cap. A breach there does not fail one test. Windows has no
# SIGALRM, so pytest-timeout falls back to the thread method and terminates the
# whole xdist worker, and the shard runs ``--max-worker-restart=0`` deliberately,
# so one fixture can fail a shard of 1600 tests in a file its author never opened.
#
# So a fixture past a few hundred entries is written with ``append_many``, the
# production group write: the same validation, the same consecutive seqs, the same
# file, one fsync per group. A group shares one ``time`` -- which is what a
# production group write does as well -- and no bound here is a bound on wall
# clock. ``test_a_grouped_fixture_is_the_log_one_append_at_a_time_writes`` pins
# that equivalence, so this stays a change in what the fixture COSTS.
