"""The session index writer must be a real separate process, and stay supervised.

Three properties, and each has its own failure mode in production:

* the indexing runs OUTSIDE this process — that is the whole point of the change,
  and a regression to a thread would be invisible except as gateway latency;
* a child that dies is replaced, and one that dies over and over is given up on
  rather than restarted forever, because search degrades to the scan path and a
  restart loop would hide that in a log;
* a child is terminated when the gateway stops, so a gateway restart does not
  leave a second writer behind competing for the same database.

The first three tests spawn real processes. That is deliberate: a mocked
``Process`` would assert the supervisor's bookkeeping while proving nothing about
spawn actually working, and spawn re-imports the module in a fresh interpreter,
which is exactly the step that breaks if the child's imports are wrong.

    The index keeps a compressed copy of each session's message text, so an
    indexer that overtakes a delete leaves that text readable after the
    transcript is gone. `index_session` holds the session's own `_locked(key)`
    for the whole stat -> read -> write, and `delete_session` removes the row
    inside the same lock before unlinking. Before this change both sides were
    threads of ONE process, so the guarantee could have rested on the in-process
    RLock and nothing would have noticed; now it rests on the `flock` being
    genuinely cross-process.

    So this holds the lock HERE and asserts the child cannot index that session
    while it is held, then that it can once released. That is a direct test of
    participation rather than of a lucky interleaving: drop `_locked` from the
    child's write path and the first assertion fails immediately.

    The session is appended INSIDE the held lock (reentrant per key per thread),
    so there is no window in which the child could index it before the lock is
