"""The nightly can carry transcripts, and only under its own grant.

Before this, ``hooks._run_once`` pushed the memory snapshot and nothing else:
the sessions archive existed and was complete, but only an owner pressing a
button ever ran it, so the conversations were the one part of an install a
nightly never protected.

The three properties the scheduling rests on, and each is a test below:

1. **The grant is its own bit.** ``nightly`` authorizes uploading memory;
   ``nightly_sessions`` authorizes uploading everything the agent was ever
   shown. Neither is ever read for the other, and the new one is absent -- so
   False -- on every install that has not asked for it.
2. **The window is its own window.** Due-ness is keyed on the SESSIONS run
   stamp, so a snapshot that ran an hour ago does not make the transcripts look
   backed up, and a wake proceeds when either kind is due.
3. **The payload is unchanged.** The loop calls ``run_sessions_backup``, the
   same function the owner-triggered archive calls, with the same arguments and
   the scheduled caller. Scheduling an existing mechanism decides nothing new
   about what is in the archive or how it is redacted; those stay properties of
   that function, and of the issue that governs it.
