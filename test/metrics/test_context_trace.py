"""Per-session per-turn injection breakdown: the read side.

``usage.context_trace(slot, days)`` is served from the slot's ``usage`` PROJECTION
-- one memoised fold of the crew log's ``context/composed`` entries;
``telemetry.api_context_trace`` is the thin HTTP wrapper. These drive the REAL
reader over a real crew log, so what is exercised is the writer, the fold and the
reader together rather than three agreeing fixtures.

The load-bearing one is :class:`TestContextTraceParityWithTheShardScan`, which pins
the payload against the shape a token-shard scan produces, written out by hand. That
shape is a LITERAL rather than a second live implementation: a comparison between two
implementations proves the two agree, which is not the same as proving either right.
