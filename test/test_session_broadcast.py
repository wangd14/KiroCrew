"""`session_broadcast`: who it reaches, in which mode, and what a partial run reports.

Three things can go wrong here and each gets its own class. The AUDIENCE, because a
default audience that is not exactly "the sessions this caller created" either
misses a worker (silently, which is the whole failure this verb is supposed to
prevent) or reaches a session the caller may not touch. The MODE, because `queue`
and `steer` are different instructions and a mistake either way is invisible:
downgrading a steer loses the urgency the caller asked for, upgrading a queue
interrupts eight turns nobody asked to interrupt. And PARTIAL DELIVERY, which is the
normal outcome rather than an error path — one target's refusal must be a row in the
report and must not cost the other targets their message.

Authorization is deliberately NOT re-tested here. Every delivery goes through
`send_to_target`, whose gate is pinned in `test_session_control.py`; what this file
pins is that the broadcast really does route each target through it, which the
fence tests below do by asserting the refusal comes back as a row.

    Sequential delivery is what makes this the sharpest failure in the verb: the

    beneath it, so before the per-target bound existed one wedged session held the
    loop forever and targets behind it never heard a "stop, the issue was already
    fixed" at all. The caller did not even get a report — the client's request
    budget expired and the whole broadcast read as failed.

    The hang is expressed with an Event that is never set, so nothing here waits on
    real time; the bound itself is patched down to keep the run instant. Separate
    cases cancel at both awaits before authorization, retain the text as a pending
