"""Tests for the steer-loss fix: unconsumed mid-turn steers are requeued.

A steer handed to kiro-cli lives inside the running turn; if the turn dies
before kiro-cli echoes ``steering_consumed`` (stall-cancel, soft STOP, error,
or a steer racing the turn's natural end) the message would vanish silently.
Pending steers are tracked on the slot:

  * the steer handler registers in ``slot._pending_steers`` BEFORE the steer
    RPC's await (unwound on failure), so a turn dying mid-write still sees it;
  * ``EVENT_STEER_CONSUMED`` settles pending steers matched against the echo's
    ``<user_message>``-wrapped snapshot (late arrivals stay pending; an empty
    echo falls back to settling all);
  * ``_run_chat``'s finally requeues leftovers at the HEAD of the slot queue
    as ordinary, individually-cancellable queue cards (``queue_push``);
  * a hard kill (force stop) discards pending steers alongside the queue —
    mirroring the existing "second press = discard everything" semantics.

        `client.steer()` returns. Under stdin backpressure that RPC is still in
