"""Tests for the user-service install/uninstall path.

Two layers tested separately:
  - Pure rendering tests (render_unit / render_plist) — no system calls,
    can run on any platform.
  - Controller dispatch tests — assert that ``current_platform()`` routes
    to the right module and that ``UNSUPPORTED`` produces the expected
    exit code.

Tests do not actually invoke ``systemctl`` or ``launchctl``. The
subprocess calls in :mod:`kiro_crew.service.linux` and
:mod:`kiro_crew.service.macos` are mocked.

    ``system`` / ``user`` describe the unit in that scope: ``None`` is a scope
    with no unit (systemd answers ``LoadState=not-found``), a dict is the
    ``ActiveState`` / ``SubState`` pair of a loaded unit (plus an optional
    ``Result``, ``success`` when absent). ``user_bus_error`` makes
    every ``systemctl --user`` call fail the way an unreachable user manager does
    (exit 1, the diagnostic on stderr, nothing on stdout). ``user_fragment`` is the
    ``FragmentPath`` systemd reports for the user unit, ``user_id`` the canonical
    ``Id`` it resolves the name to (another unit's name when ours is an alias) and
    ``user_load`` / ``system_load`` its ``LoadState`` (``masked`` for a mask, which
    a running unit keeps running under). ``system_fragment`` is the ``FragmentPath``
    reported for the system unit; ``None`` makes it the module's ``UNIT_PATH`` as
    the test left it (the installer's own path), so a test names another location
    only for a unit the installer did not write. ``overrides`` maps a verb to the
    ``CompletedProcess`` it should return instead, for the one-verb-fails cases (a
    restart the manager refuses).

    The fake is stateful the way the manager is: a scope told to ``stop`` (and
    not refused) answers ``inactive (dead)`` to every later ``show`` /
    ``is-active`` / ``status`` -- unless ``stop_is_ignored``, which models a stop
    job that returned 0 while the unit is still up. ``restart_lands_in`` models a
    ``Type=simple`` unit whose ``restart`` exits 0 whatever the forked process
    does next: a dict, or a sequence of dicts answered to successive ``show``
    reads of the restarted scope (the last one sticky), so a unit that reads
    ``active`` once and then ``activating (auto-restart)`` is one entry each.

    Nothing here spawns anything: the whole point of the fixture is that the
    systemd user manager is host state and must never be touched from a test.
