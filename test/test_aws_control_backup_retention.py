"""Cloud backup retention: keep the newest N archives, erase the rest by VERSION.

Every AWS call in here is a fake. Two layers are faked, and which one a test uses
is the point of that test:

* the retention tests patch ``storage.list_object_versions`` /
  ``storage.delete_object_versions``, so they assert what retention DECIDES;
* the storage tests patch ``storage._checked``, the package's single AWS CLI
  chokepoint, so they assert the argv that would have gone to the CLI.

No test reaches a network, a profile or a bucket. The drive under test is
versioned, which is why "delete the object" is never the assertion: a delete
without a ``VersionId`` writes a marker and the bytes keep billing, so the tests
pin the version-pinned form specifically.
