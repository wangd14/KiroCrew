"""The goose backend: vocabulary, the routing seed, and the read-back.

The read-back is what this file mostly exists for. Every other ratchet in the tree
already holds goose to a declaration -- that it has a label, an install probe, a
credential leaf, a column in every bucket -- and a declaration is exactly the thing
that can be true while the behaviour is absent. What no other test reaches is
:meth:`AcpClient._verify_goose_routing`: whether a session whose mode is not the
required one is actually REFUSED, on both the path that creates a session and the path
that restores one.

That second path is the one with teeth. The environment seed governs a session goose
creates; it does not govern one goose already has. So a resumed session can come back
in the auto-approving mode with the seed still in the child's environment, and the only
thing standing between that and a session where no tool call reaches the host gate is
the read-back running on the load response too.
