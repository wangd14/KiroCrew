"""Slack Reconnect: ``GatewayOrchestrator.reconnect_slack`` + ``POST /api/slack/reconnect``.

Slack credentials are hoisted once, in ``GatewayOrchestrator.__init__``, and
nothing reassigned them afterwards, so a token or owner ID saved from the
dashboard could take effect only through ``POST /api/restart``. These tests
pin the in-place alternative:

* the orchestrator re-reads the store, recomputes ``_slack_enabled`` from the
  tokens now on disk (a stale ``False`` would make ``init_socket_mode`` a
  silent no-op), tears the old socket client down, re-awaits
  ``init_socket_mode`` on the running loop and records the outcome where the
  settings badge reads it;
* a store that cannot be read leaves the live connection untouched;
* the dashboard's Slack client mirror is cleared with the old socket and
  published again only behind a connected one, and the dashboard's
  ``owner_id`` follows the saved owner -- so a rejected workspace or a former
  owner never keeps dashboard access through a reconnect;
* the handler module's authorization subject (owner + allowlist) follows the
  saved owner on EVERY reconnect, including the ones that stop before a
  handshake, and an old socket client that will not close aborts the attempt
  with that subject cleared -- so a listener that outlives its credentials
  accepts no privileged command from the former owner;
* concurrent callers share one handshake;
* the route carries the PUT's direct-local gate and answers the
  ``connected`` / ``connect_error`` shape ``GET /api/slack/config`` documents.

The orchestrator is built through ``__new__`` (its ``__init__`` boots the
world); ``init_socket_mode`` and ``_connect_slack`` are replaced by recorders
because a real handshake needs Slack.

    leaves: the map is already dirty with the deletion, so its next deferred
    write (or ``aclose`` at shutdown) would land it under an identity that was
    never adopted -- and if the operator then reverts to the former workspace's
