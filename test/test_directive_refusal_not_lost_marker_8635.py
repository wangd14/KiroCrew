"""A directive tool's decline must not be defeated by, or mistaken for, its text.

Two defects, one seam. ``autonudge_stop``'s ``reason`` was a hard-capped 500-char
field, and ``mcp_core._call_tool`` validates arguments in the dispatch wrapper
*ahead of* the handler -- so an over-long reason returned a bare
``"Error: reason: exceeds max length 500 …"`` and ``_emit_directive`` never ran.
Nothing was published on either channel, so:

1. **The loop was not stopped.** The agent asked to stop and the loop kept
   waking. On the reporting host one agent was rejected twice in a row (1391 then
   649 chars) and its loop survived both attempts.
2. **The lost-marker WARNING was being trained to be ignored.** The consumer had
   already authenticated the call as a directive tool via ``_meta.kiro``, so a
   marker-less final frame landed in the branch that logs
   ``session-directive decode FAILED … effect dropped`` -- a line that exists to
   catch a rawOutput-envelope escaping regression, firing ~10x/day on routine
   argument rejections.

The tests split along the two halves of the fix:

* **Clamp** -- the ``reason`` field of the two stop tools opts into
  ``FieldSpec.clamp_to_max``, so a long explanation is truncated (visibly, with a
  note carrying the original length) and the stop still happens. Opt-in only: an
  ordinary capped field still rejects.
* **Refusal tag** -- every marker-less return from a directive tool is stamped
  with the refusal sentinel at the producer, so the consumer reports it at INFO
  as a refusal and ``decode FAILED`` means exactly one thing again. Includes the
  end-to-end check through ``TurnDriver``: a real rejection string, produced by
  really calling the tool, must not fire the WARNING.
