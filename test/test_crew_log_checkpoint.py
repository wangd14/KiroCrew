#:

#: this one. What obliges a bump is an EXISTING fold's digest moving.

#: credit bucket per source, so a savepoint written at 3 describes different meaning, and
#: ``status``, ``timeline`` and ``class`` moved with it because the script above grew the

    counting fix in ``usage`` or ``status`` being the likely one. A savepoint written by
    the old build then resumes onto the new logic, so the long sessions this module
    exists to speed up are exactly the ones that keep serving pre-fix numbers, for the

    The obligation is therefore recorded as a test rather than as a sentence: prose
    cannot fail, and a rule nothing enforces is one a future fix forgets. The digest is

    deliberately outside it: a rendering change moves the cold fold and the resumed fold
    together, so an old savepoint stays valid.

    The pin is PER FOLD because the retirement is. A file carries the version of the
    fold it holds, so a fold that changed meaning is the only one whose savepoints must
    go -- and pinning the digests against one shared number would demand a bump that
    retires five valid savepoints to retire one stale one, which is the cost this
