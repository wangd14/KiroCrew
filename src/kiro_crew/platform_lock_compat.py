"""Cross-process advisory file locks, one contract on POSIX and Windows.

POSIX takes ``fcntl.flock``. Windows takes a byte-range ``msvcrt.locking`` lock on
byte 0, acquired by spinning on the non-blocking code, because msvcrt's own blocking
code gives up with ``EDEADLOCK``. Both acquires are bounded by a ceiling and fail
closed past it, and both are single-shot on the asyncio event-loop thread.
:func:`open_create_or_existing` creates or opens a lock sidecar race-safely, and
:func:`probe_file_persistence` checks that a directory supports every primitive the
locked stores rely on.

``kiro_crew.platform_compat`` re-exports every name here, and a patch through it
lands here.

# The helpers read the platform flag (``IS_POSIX``), the lock modules (``fcntl``,

# inside the function that uses them: a test that rebinds one of those there -- to
# force the Windows branch, or to fake the clock a ceiling is measured on -- reaches
# the helper at call time. The facade binds only the lock module this platform has, so
# each of the two is imported at the point where its branch first uses it. Circular
# import: ``kiro_crew.platform_compat`` imports this module while it loads.

# msvcrt's blocking lock codes (LK_LOCK / LK_RLCK) are NOT the equivalent of
# fcntl.flock(LOCK_EX): rather than waiting until the lock is free, they retry
# ~10 times at 1s intervals and then RAISE EDEADLOCK (errno 36). Swallowing
# that as "acquired" lets a caller run its read-modify-write with no exclusion
# and silently lose writes. So the Windows "blocking" acquire spins on the
# non-blocking code (LK_NBLCK) instead — the same idiom cron._file_lock uses.
# It is bounded rather than truly unbounded because a contended fd and a
# non-writable fd are indistinguishable on Windows (both surface as errno 13
# EACCES), so an unbounded spin would turn a permission error into a hang.
#
# Two ceilings, because on-loop and off-loop have opposite needs:
#  - OFF the loop (cron, app backends — threads/subprocesses): the wait must
#    cover a legitimately long holder that can hold the lock across a
#    multi-second operation, and a waiter there must NOT give up and race it. So
#    use a generous ceiling that no real hold approaches.
#  - ON the loop (e.g. bridges._mcp_lock during app enable): a spin-sleep would
#    freeze chat/heartbeat, so that path never sleeps at all (single-shot).

    """Acquire an advisory lock on ``fd`` for the duration of the block.

    POSIX: ``fcntl.flock(LOCK_EX|LOCK_SH)`` with ``LOCK_UN`` release, acquired by
    polling the non-blocking code up to ``_LOCK_TIMEOUT_SECS``. ``flock`` itself
    takes no timeout, and an unbounded wait on a stuck holder is not a wait but a
    hang: on the boot path it leaves a gateway that binds no port and logs
    nothing, which no supervisor or health check can act on.
    Windows: ``msvcrt.locking`` on the first byte, acquired by spinning on the
    non-blocking code up to ``_LOCK_TIMEOUT_SECS`` — because msvcrt's own
    "blocking" code gives up after ~10s with EDEADLOCK, which cannot be treated
    as a wait. ``msvcrt`` has no shared mode, so a shared request is satisfied
    with an exclusive lock (correctness over concurrency — readers genuinely
    serialize with the holder, but never see torn writes).

    On BOTH platforms, if the lock cannot be taken within the ceiling
    ``file_lock`` FAILS CLOSED — it raises rather than entering the critical
    section unserialized, since proceeding lock-less is the exact fail-open that
    loses writes. On BOTH platforms the acquire is additionally single-shot when
    called on the asyncio event-loop thread: a poll-sleep there would freeze chat
    and heartbeat for the whole wait, and a freeze long enough to miss a heartbeat
    is a supervisor kill, so a contended on-loop caller is refused at once and
    fails closed rather than stalling every other session. ``flock`` counts a
    second descriptor in this same process as a competing holder, so even a
    sibling thread's brief critical section refuses an on-loop caller: a caller
    that must wait for the lock calls this from a worker thread
    (``asyncio.to_thread``), where the wait is a real one. The timeout is a safety
    ceiling against a stuck holder, not a normal wait. ``required`` is kept for
    call-site intent and does not change the outcome (both paths refuse to proceed
    without the lock).

    *timeout* overrides that ceiling for a caller whose critical section is
    legitimately long, and must be set by any caller that can hold the lock past
    ``_LOCK_TIMEOUT_SECS``. The default suits the common case — a sub-second read
    plus an atomic rename — but it is NOT an upper bound on every in-tree holder:
    ``frontend._staging_lock`` spans an ``npm run build`` plus an install, so a
    default ceiling would refuse a contender while the holder is still working
    rather than because it is stuck. A ceiling shorter than the holder's real
    work turns a wait into a spurious refusal, which is the failure this
    parameter exists to prevent.

    *wait* is for a caller whose work is OPTIONAL and retried later, and which
    may run on the event-loop thread: with ``wait=False`` the acquire is
    single-shot on every platform and raises :class:`BlockingIOError` at once
    when the lock is held, instead of blocking the loop for as long as the holder
    keeps it. POSIX gets that from ``LOCK_NB``; Windows already behaves this way
    on the loop thread, and a zero timeout makes it uniform off the loop too.
    ``BlockingIOError`` is an ``OSError``, so it is a NARROWING of what a caller
    already had to handle, and it separates "someone else is writing right now"
    from the stuck-holder ceiling above. It changes only how long we are willing
    to wait, never whether the critical section is serialized -- a contended
    ``wait=False`` acquire raises rather than proceeding.

    Note: on Windows, ``msvcrt.locking`` requires seeking to byte 0, so the
    ``fd`` must be a dedicated lock file; callers must not rely on the file
    offset being preserved across the context manager boundary.

    """Verify that *directory* supports every primitive the Kiro Crew
    persistence paths depend on: creating a new file (``tempfile.mkstemp``),
    writing bytes to it, taking an advisory lock (:func:`file_lock`),
    atomically replacing it (``os.replace``), and removing it — the exact
    operations ``atomic_write`` and the ``.lock``-file helpers perform.

    Returns ``None`` when all of them work, otherwise a human-readable
    description of the first failure. A process whose environment breaks any
    of these primitives cannot save chat history, cron history, or session
    state — but it CAN still serve traffic and append to already-open log fds,
    so without this probe it limps along losing writes silently. The known way
    to get into that state is inheriting a seccomp syscall filter from a
    sandboxed parent (seccomp survives fork/exec, ``nohup`` included):
    filtered syscalls fail with ``ENOSYS`` while everything else looks
    healthy. The returned message names that cause when ``errno`` says so.

    Probe files carry a ``.persistence-probe-`` prefix, and their removal is
    part of the probed contract: an environment that allows creating files but
    denies deleting them (delete-scoped ACLs) breaks the atomic
    rename/replace paths just the same, so a failed cleanup is reported as a
    preflight failure rather than suppressed. On the failure path probe files
    are best-effort removed; one may remain only when removal itself is what
    is broken.
