"""The import-source registry, and the explicit adapters it dispatches to.

Every foreign agent the engine can read is an adapter module in this package --
``codex``, ``claude_code``, ``gemini``, ``openclaw``, ``hermes`` -- plus
``lineage``, the reader for an install of Kiro Crew's own layout that an
edition registers through the ``ImportSourceProvider`` CPP seam. An adapter
knows ONE layout: where its files are, which configs outrank which, and which
of its directories have no destination. It reads through
:mod:`kiro_crew.onboarding_scan` and projects through
:mod:`kiro_crew.onboarding_plan`, so every content gate applies to every
source alike.

This module is the registry over them: the builtin descriptors, the single
normalization boundary every descriptor crosses (:func:`_normalize_source`),
the per-context registry cache, root and context resolution, the
failure-isolated dispatch of one adapter (:func:`_scan_source`), and the
managed / superseded MCP name sets ``mcp_cleanup`` reads through the
``onboarding_import`` facade.
See docs/system-specs/modules/onboarding-import.md, "Registering a source".
