"""Session teardown and identity-retirement boundary.

This leaf module owns the lifecycle state that survives across individual
provider objects, while the ``SessionManager`` facade remains the authority for
session allocation, warm-pool state, background runtimes, compaction policy,
and persistence.  Cross-boundary calls deliberately route through ``owner`` so
existing instance monkeypatch seams remain observable after wiring.

There is no runtime import of :mod:`kiro_crew.session`.  Patchable module
globals, provider types, process helpers, and policy constants are resolved by
call-time dependencies supplied by the facade.

    The facade opens a scope around every ``reset`` and hands it in; ``reset``
    records the session it pops into the scope in the same lock hold as the pop,
    and the scope's exit releases the entry. The release is the scope's and not a
    ``finally`` inside ``reset`` because the pop sits under the registry lock at
    the top of a teardown whose awaits span the rest of that method: the hold has
    to outlive every one of them, which a caller-side ``with`` does without
    re-indenting the teardown. A ``reset`` called with no scope records nothing.

    Every teardown in flight under a key holds its own entry. A key has one live
    session to pop at a time, but teardowns overlap: a cold start can register a
    successor under the key while the first teardown still hangs, and that
    successor's own reset can pop it and hang as well. A reader ending the key
    (the cron reaper) must reach BOTH processes -- retaining the first popper
    alone hid a hung successor behind a record that said ``reaped`` -- so each
    scope records the session its reset popped beside the others under the key,
    in pop order, and removes exactly that entry, by identity, when its teardown
    ends -- return, raise or cancellation alike. Bounded by construction: an
    entry lives exactly as long as the reset coroutine that recorded it, which
    already holds that session, so the table adds a reference to each teardown in
    flight and never a lifetime; a cap would only recreate the invisibility.

    The scope also answers a question the table cannot: which session did THIS
    reset pop? A caller that resets a key and then has to kill what the reset
    could not stop (the cron reaper, when its own reset times out) cannot learn
    that from a snapshot taken before the reset -- a cold start can register a
    new session under the key between the snapshot and the pop, and it is that
    session the reset pops and then hangs on. So a caller-supplied ``on_pop``
    runs in the same lock hold as the pop, for every pop, so whatever it reads
    off the session (a process handle) is read atomically with the pop and
    before any await that could lose it. The table's own entry reads the same
    handle at the same instant (:class:`TornDown`), for the readers that did
    not open this scope: the run's own finally reset, and a successor's, are
    teardowns the cron reaper never started and can reach only through the
    table -- and only on the handle captured before their awaits cleared the

    escaped children. One answer governs both, because a process worth keeping is
    a process whose children are in use.

    Asked of the ownership registry rather than of the session table, which is the
    same registry the kill gate consults and the reason there is one: a session
    table scan would have to read each session's own pid to compare, and a
    per-session pid reading attributes one shared process to one of its tenants.
    It is also the only source that sees a session which holds the process but is
    not registered yet -- a joiner takes its lease during ``provider.start`` and
    enters the table only once that RETURNS, so for the length of a cold start the
    table shows no survivor at all.

    Both kinds of holder count, because both are parties the gate refuses a kill
    for: a LEASE is a chat session resident on the process, and a TENANCY is a
    subagent mid-turn on it.

    The session being reset is not excluded, and needs no excluding: its own
    ``provider.shutdown()`` has already run and released whatever it held, so a
    count above zero is somebody else by construction.

        session is unreachable from the pop on -- a reader that arrives after it (the
        cron reaper, when the run's own finally reset popped the session and hung)
        then has no handle to the process this teardown holds.

        ``ends_conversation=True`` says the caller is ending the conversation, not
        recycling it, and then this parent's runs are stopped like any other parent end.
        Most endings are a different verb (``remove``, ``destroy``,
        ``discard_conversation``, ``remove_if_unclaimed``,
        ``retire_kiro_identity_sessions``), but some reach only this one, so the intent
        has to be sayable here. The callers that pass it are named in
        ``docs/system-specs/modules/session.md``; a test pins that they still do.

        The default is the recycle because that is what the overwhelming majority of the
        ~46 callers are, and the cost of the two mistakes is not symmetric -- but a MISSED
        flag costs MORE than an orphan, which is the number a new caller has to weigh. It
        arms no delivery gate either, so the child's report still reaches ``_on_done``,
        which resolves the parent through ``get_or_create`` -- the call that CREATES a
        session when none is live -- so the conversation the caller ended re-opens, seeded
        with that report. That is the headline defect in full, not a bounded process. A
        wrong ``True`` destroys live work for a conversation that comes right back, which
        is why the default stays the recycle. Nothing structural catches an omission,
        because a keyword is invisible to the AST ratchet, which is exactly why
        ``test_the_conversation_ending_reset_callers_say_so`` pins the callers BY PATH.

        ``refuse_only_on_active_turn`` narrows ``skip_if_busy`` to a DECLARED turn, which a
        caller acting on an explicit user request needs: a channel member holds its lease for
        its whole listening life, so refusing on the lease alone refuses that caller forever
        and the retry-when-idle it offers can never succeed.

        The conversation-ended half of a parent end, on its own. Every other verb here
        reaches it as part of tearing a session down, but a caller can replace the
        conversation on a LIVE process -- the workflow pool does exactly that when it hands
        a warm worker to the next task through ``provider.new_conversation()``. The process
        survives and the conversation does not, so the children of the conversation that
        ended have nowhere to report: without this they inject into whatever the reused
        worker is doing next.

        Same two-phase shape as the teardown verbs, for the same reason: the snapshot is
        taken under the registry lock so it cannot name the runs of a conversation that
        starts after it, and the cancel runs outside the lock because it awaits.

        No provider shutdown, no map mutation, no runtime release: this verb makes exactly
        one claim, that the conversation is over. In particular it does NOT advance the
        key's ownership generation -- that counter belongs to session allocation, the

        the two halves of ending a parent belong together.

        The pairing is what makes the rule backend-independent. Releasing the

        a parent end already ends the children of a harness that multiplexes —
        as a side effect of reaping the process, not as a decision. A harness
        that runs one process per child has no entry in ``_subagent_runtimes``,
        so the release reaches nothing and its children outlive the conversation
        that asked for them, each holding its own agent process and that
        process's MCP fleet until its own run timeout expires. Asking the manager
        to cancel makes the same thing happen for every harness, by intent, and

        parent end must not hang or fail on an unresponsive child, and the

        ``close_all`` is deliberately NOT a caller. Gateway shutdown cancels
        every run at once through ``SubagentManager.cancel_all``, which also

        work is the defect this change exists to remove); instead the reapers
        DISPLACE it out of the claimable slot -- popped from the registry (or
        the ``_bg`` slot) and parked on a drain list -- so a new acquisition
        spawns a replacement under the live account rather than demuxing
        fresh sessions onto the wrong-account process, and the parked
        runtime is killed by a later pass once its in-flight work drains.

        """Retire idle Kiro-backed companion runtimes.

        This method is the module's ONLY companion-runtime retirement path
        outside the paired parent-end sites: it reaps exclusively IDLE
        runtimes, so it has no running child to end (the fact its ratchet
        exemption in ``test_every_parent_end_release_site_ends_its_children``
        rests on). Callers that need a narrower reap -- the spawn-identity
        stamp gate retires only PROVEN wrong-account runtimes -- pass
        ``should_retire`` rather than calling ``release_subagent_runtime``
        themselves, which would widen that exemption.

        ``should_retire`` filters which idle runtimes are reaped (``None``
        retires every kiro-backed one -- identity-sweep semantics). The
        sweep-quiescence post-conditions (spawn locks held, runtimes still
        registered) only apply to the unfiltered sweep, since under a filter
        the surviving runtimes are the expected outcome, not incompleteness.
        ``retired`` collects the parent keys actually released. ``live`` is
        the unfiltered sweep's spare: a REGISTERED runtime whose spawn stamp
        equals it (``spawned_under``) provably authenticated as the live
        account, so it is neither released nor counted by the post-conditions
        -- the same spare the session loop applies, without which a sweep on a
        host with any subagent in flight could never complete. Ignored under
        a filter, and not consulted by the parked-runtime reaper that runs
        first in the body: a parked runtime is a proven wrong-account holder
        and still drains. The release itself is pinned to the runtime this
        pass looked at (``expected=``): the sweep waits for the per-parent
        lock behind any respawn in flight, and that respawn installs a
        live-stamped replacement under the same key before letting go, which
        a pop by key alone would kill. A skipped release leaves the
        replacement to the post-condition, which spares it if live-stamped.

        Under a filter, a runtime the predicate proves wrong-account is
        DISPLACED rather than killed, busy and idle alike: popped from the
        claimable registry (its per-parent spawn lock is dropped with it, so
        a waiter retries against the live map and spawns a replacement under
        the live account) and parked on ``_draining_subagent_runtimes`` until
        its in-flight work finishes. Leaving it registered is one hole this
        closes -- the registry is what ``get_subagent_runtime`` hands to NEW
        demuxed sessions, so "busy, catch it later" kept the wrong-account
        process claimable for the whole drain. Killing an IDLE-looking one on
        the same pass is the other: the busy probe races a claim that was
        handed the runtime but has not yet opened its init scope, so the kill
        is always deferred to the drain reap at the top of this method, which
        fires only on a later pass, only once the park grace has elapsed, and
        only when the runtime still has no active or initializing sessions
        (probes fail toward busy, preserving work). The unfiltered sweep
        keeps its skip-busy contract untouched: its completeness signal is
        what drives retries, and its busy sessions are already flagged for
        next-turn retirement.
