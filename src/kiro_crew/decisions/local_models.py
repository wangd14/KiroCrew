"""Local System One models the decision seam can use instead of hosted Jev.

A local model is an open-weight decision server the owner runs on this machine,
speaking the same ``/v1/systemone`` wire format Jev does, so :class:`JevOracle`
talks to it unchanged. This module owns three things:

* the PRESETS the dashboard offers, each with the numbers a reader needs to
  choose one -- how close it comes to Jev, how much memory it needs, how slow it
  is on a CPU;
* :func:`is_loopback_endpoint`, the one test for "this endpoint is on this
  machine", which ``impl_jev`` uses to withhold the Jev key and the provider
  route uses to decide whether a switch may carry consent across;
* :func:`endpoint_for`, which builds a preset's endpoint from a port, so no
  caller ever composes a local URL from caller-supplied text.

The quality numbers are the share of Jev's correct answers each model matched on
the same 231 public JevBench items (easy, original and hard tiers), measured on a
10-core CPU. Jev answered 200 of them correctly (48/48, 71/72, 81/111); the hard
tier gets its own number because it is where the models separate. They are
measurements of one host, not guarantees, and the card says so.
