    resolves the name; if a junction there aims at ``\\\\host\\share`` that
    resolution IS an outbound SMB authentication, and no later refusal recalls
    it.

    ``DirEntry.is_symlink()`` alone is not enough and is exactly how ``rglob``
    came to descend a junction: a junction's tag is ``IO_REPARSE_TAG_MOUNT_POINT``
    rather than ``IO_REPARSE_TAG_SYMLINK``, so that method reports False for one
    while ``is_dir(follow_symlinks=False)`` reports True.

    Every reparse point is treated the same rather than only link-shaped ones,

    skip, never the enforcement. On POSIX the attribute check is skipped
    entirely; ``is_symlink()`` uses ``d_type`` and costs nothing, and asking for

    The export's own enumeration, in place of ``rglob``. ``rglob`` DESCENDS a
    Windows junction, and every by-name question then asked about what it yields
    resolves that junction before any guard has run. Measured on this module
    before the change, exporting a workspace holding one pre-planted junction:
    twelve resolving calls went out through it -- four ``os.path.realpath``,
    eight ``ntpath._getfinalpathname`` -- while the export correctly archived
    nothing from behind it. Nothing being archived was never the question. If the
    junction names a UNC share those resolutions are the outbound authentication,
    and containment refusing the bytes afterwards has already paid the cost it
    exists to prevent.

    So this descends and verifies in one motion, root first:

    1. the directory is PINNED. :func:`platform_compat.pin_directory` opens it
       with ``OPEN_REPARSE_POINT``, so a junction sitting at the name fails here
       instead of being traversed -- the refusal and the open are one operation,
       not a check followed by an open. On Windows the handle also omits
       ``FILE_SHARE_DELETE``, so while it lives neither that directory nor
       anything above it can be renamed or deleted;
    2. only then is it listed, and each child classified from the listing itself
       (:func:`_entry_is_link`) -- nothing resolves a child;
    3. a child directory is descended only by re-entering at step 1, so the path
       the kernel walks to reach component *n* runs entirely through components
       already opened and verified;
    4. a child file is opened by :func:`_open_verified`, which does not follow a
       reparse point at the final name, while its whole parent chain is still
       held.

    Each pin is held for as long as the subtree under it is being produced --
    a generator frame stays alive across ``yield``, so an outer level's handle
    outlives the inner walk -- and released in ``finally``, which also runs when
    the consumer abandons the walk. Depth, not breadth, bounds how many are open.

    *keep* is asked about relative paths only and must not touch the filesystem.
    It is applied to FILES only, exactly where the old loop applied it: matching
    a directory NAME does not prune its contents, because ``_is_excluded``
    decides that through ``parts`` and did so before.

    On POSIX ``pin_directory`` is ``O_RDONLY | O_DIRECTORY | O_NOFOLLOW``. Its
    refusal of a symlinked directory is real there and is what ``rglob`` already
    did, so the set of exported files is unchanged; the anti-rename property is
    NOT real there -- POSIX has no such lock -- and nothing here relies on it.
    Containment on POSIX rests where it always did, on ``_open_verified``
    checking the descriptor's real path.

    """Make an imported cron store safe to load and safe to run.

    Returns ``(dropped, paused)`` — two lists, because they are two different
    outcomes and a caller that conflates them tells the user the wrong thing. A
    dropped job is gone; a paused one is fully restored and simply waiting to be
    switched on. Rewrites *crons_path* in place. A missing file is left alone.

    The store is read and written as UTF-8, never through the locale codepage.
    Cron job names are operator-authored text and routinely non-ASCII — the same
    reason ``snapshot._merge_crons``, which merges this very file a few lines
    later in ``apply_import_zip``, pins ``encoding="utf-8"`` on both ends. A bare
    ``read_text()`` here decodes the archive's UTF-8 with the host codepage, and
    both outcomes are wrong: a codepage that cannot decode the bytes raises
    ``UnicodeDecodeError``, which IS a ``ValueError`` and therefore lands in the
    recovery arm below — replacing a perfectly good backup with an empty store
    and reporting it as unreadable — while a codepage that decodes most bytes
    (cp1252) yields mojibake that the rewrite below then persists to disk.

    Three rules, each closing a different way an archive can act on the host:

    1. A job that is not an object, or whose ``schedule`` is not one, is DROPPED.
       ``CronService._load`` skips such a record with a warning and it is then
       silently dropped from the store on the next write — dead weight with an
       invisible deadline. Dropping it at import, with the drop REPORTED to the
       user, is the honest version of the same outcome.

    2. A ``command`` is vetted with ``mcp_cron._vet_shell_command``, so it is
       judged exactly as the same command would be at ``cron_add`` (deny-list,
       sensitive-path, credential-path and exfiltration checks). A failure DROPS
       the job, and so does the vet itself raising — an unverifiable command must
       not be scheduled.

    3. A job that survives with a ``command``, and any job naming a ``script``,
       is imported DISABLED (``user_paused``) rather than live, and reported as
       PAUSED, not rejected. The vet bounds what a command may do, not whether the
       user asked for THIS command on THIS machine, and a ``script`` cannot be
       vetted at all: the export never carries the ``crons/`` directory, so the
       name resolves against whatever the target already has there. Both become an
       ambush if they start running on their own. Disabling keeps the restore — the
       jobs, their schedules and their history are all still there — while making
       the first run an explicit human action. Message-only jobs are untouched:
       they prompt an agent, they do not execute anything on the host.
