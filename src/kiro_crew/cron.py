"""Cron service for scheduling agent tasks.

Jobs are stored in the config directory (``~/.kiro/crew/crons.json`` by default,
overridden by ``KIROCREW_HOME``) and executed by a background
asyncio timer.  Each job fires a callback (typically delivering the result to
the dashboard and, when configured, the owner's Slack DM).

Cross-process safety: the CLI and gateway run as separate processes sharing
the same ``crons.json``.  All read-modify-write cycles use advisory file
locking (fcntl), and a content-digest ``_sync()`` detects external file changes
before every mutation.  Job execution releases the lock so long-running jobs
don't block the CLI.

Jobs are created via MCP tools (``cron_add``) or the CLI (``kirocrew cron add``).

Supports three schedule types:
- ``every`` — recurring interval (min 60s)
- ``at`` — one-shot at a unix timestamp
- ``cron`` — standard cron expression (min hour dom month dow)

:class:`CronService` is defined here and composes the owners in
:mod:`kiro_crew.cron_service` (schedule evaluation, the job record, run identity,
run claims, run deadlines, the store format and lock, field validation, the
serviceless store readers, cron folders). It keeps the service's live state, its
run lifecycle, the reaper and ``cancel()`` teardown, and every store transaction.

This module is also the subsystem's import and patch surface: every function,
class and constant it defined before those owners moved out still resolves here
as the same object.
The names tests patch here that moved code reads -- ``datetime``,
``get_local_tz``, ``published_config_timezone``, ``cron_expr_matches``,
``config_dir``, ``_record_is_enabled``, ``sel`` and ``_JOB_TIMEOUT_SECS`` -- the
owners read through this module on each call, so a patch here reaches them.

    A FALSY key (``None`` or ``""``) is one of the "any other key" cases, not an
    input error: ``session_key`` is an optional caller-supplied field, so the
    falsy-skip at creation persists ``None`` on the row, and an ownerless row is
    the documented state the CLI and the Schedule page manage. A non-string JSON
    value is malformed persisted data, but it gets the same non-cron answer here:
    this parser is shared by removal cleanup, where calling ``.startswith`` on a
    list or mapping would abort after the target row was filtered from memory and
    let a later save silently commit a removal the caller saw fail. Answering
    ``""`` here is what every consumer already expects of a non-cron owner -- the

    paths give one (``if not job.session_key: continue``). Guarding at this one

    The first two are ``(id, name)`` pairs needing attention. ``loadable``
    rides the SAME read rather than a second one: a store the scheduler cannot
    load yields two empty buckets, which is indistinguishable from a healthy
    empty store in the pairs alone, so the caller needs the flag to avoid
    handing back a clean bill of health for a stopped scheduler.

    Read-only + best-effort, and a sibling of :func:`referenced_skill_names` for
    the same reason: it reads ``crons.json`` directly so it needs no running
    scheduler. ``kirocrew doctor`` is the caller, and a diagnostic whose purpose
    is to speak when the gateway is wedged must not depend on the gateway.

    Non-raising by contract, via :func:`_read_job_records`, which owns the
    read-parse-shape prologue this and the two other direct readers share: a
    missing file (every fresh install — no crons yet), unreadable bytes,
    invalid UTF-8, malformed JSON (including deeply nested input), a store not
    shaped like a job list, and individual malformed records all report
    "nothing found". The run on a host with a corrupt store is exactly the run
    that most needs the caller's other diagnostics, and must not get a
    traceback instead of them.

    The two buckets are disjoint and carry different remediation. A job only
    reaches ``auto_paused`` by failing repeatedly, so it almost always carries
    ``last_status="error"`` too; reporting it in both would give a caller
    contradictory advice (resume it vs. re-trigger it) for one job. Auto-pause
    wins because re-triggering a paused job does not un-pause it.

    A user-paused job appears in NEITHER bucket. ``user_paused`` is deliberately
    distinct from ``auto_paused``: a job the user paused on purpose is not a
    health signal, and a stale ``last_status`` from before they paused it is not
    either. Both flags can be set at once — :meth:`CronStore._enable_job_locked`
    clears ``auto_paused`` only when ENABLING, so pausing an already-auto-paused
    job leaves ``auto_paused`` true and adds ``user_paused`` — and the explicit
    user pause is the later, more specific instruction, so it wins.

# loop-resident callers use the ``*_async`` mutators (which ``asyncio.to_thread``
# the lock+save) and the synchronous ``CronSDK`` facade offloads to a worker
# thread when a loop is running — but conventions drift as new writers are
# added. ``_file_lock`` therefore MACHINE-ENFORCES the rule: on entry it detects
# a running loop on the current thread and, when strict mode is enabled, RAISES
# so a regression is caught in CI rather than silently re-freezing the loop.
#
# Gating mirrors the repo's other strict rails (e.g. KIROCREW_STRICT_ON_LOOP_
# PERSIST): OFF by default it degrades to a throttled warning (so no production
# path is broken by an unforeseen legitimate on-loop caller, and existing tests
# that seed jobs via the sync mutators from an async body keep passing); the CI
# loop-safety regression test flips it ON to prove the guard fires and that the
# sanctioned async / offloaded-sync paths do NOT trip it. Operators can export

        stop -- a manager without the fence, or a door this reasoning missed --

        Removing a cron retires its principal: ``cron:<job id>`` is presented

        it deliberately SKIPS a live cron principal, so a transcript deleted
        before the cron is removed leaves nothing behind to notice later.

        Released, not deleted or re-parented — the same semantics the delete
        funnel uses. A child is the user's own scheduled work; only its owner is
        gone, so it drops to the documented ownerless state the CLI and the

        (``cron:<parent>:<run id>``, ``cron:<parent>:<agent>``) is caught too.

        Sync core of :meth:`release_jobs_owned_by` — lock/reload/select/mutate/
        save only, no timer work (so it is safe in an executor thread;
        ``_arm_timer`` needs the event loop). Same shape, and the same critical
        property, as :meth:`_remove_jobs_by_owner_locked`: BOTH decisions this
        makes — which owner keys name a retired principal, and which jobs still
        carry one of them — happen AFTER the in-lock ``_sync_for_write()``
        reload, against the authoritative on-disk state rather than a snapshot
        taken before the lock.

        That is the whole reason this exists instead of a caller-side
        ``list_jobs()`` loop over :meth:`adopt_job`. ``list_jobs`` is cache-only
        with up to one timer-poll interval of cross-process staleness, and both
        decisions are wrong when read from it:

        * OWNER staleness — between a pre-lock snapshot and a per-id write,
          another surface (the CLI's ``cron adopt``, a cron-injected slot
          re-stamping its key) can hand the job to a DIFFERENT owner, and an
          unconditional per-id release would clear that new owner, silently
          unbinding a job from a session that legitimately owns it.
        * PRINCIPAL staleness — a ``cron:<job id>`` owner is only live while that
          job exists, so its jobs must be kept owned; but a CLI ``cron remove``
          inside the staleness window leaves the cache still listing the job, and
          a cached liveness check would call the dead principal live and skip
          releasing its children. Nothing re-runs the delete funnel, so those
          jobs strand permanently.

        Conditioning both on the reloaded state makes the release a
        compare-and-clear against current truth: a re-adopted job keeps its new
        owner, a job whose cron principal is still scheduled keeps its owner, and
        either is simply absent from the returned ids.

        Ownership is matched through :func:`cron_owner_matches`, not ``==``,
        because one cron principal is stamped under several spellings
        (``cron:<job id>``, ``cron:<job id>:<run id>``,
        ``cron:<job id>:<agent>``) depending on which run created the job. An
        exact comparison misses a child stamped with a longer spelling than the
        caller holds, and a match MISS is not a release failure, so nothing warns.

        The active exact-key registry is snapshotted only AFTER this transaction
        acquires ``_file_lock`` and reloads the store. The short in-process
        ``_active_session_lock`` makes that worker-thread read coherent with loop
        registrations. A run that registered and persisted a child before this
        lock was acquired is therefore visible in both snapshots; a run that
        registers later cannot persist its child until this transaction releases
        the same store lock. This closes the snapshot-to-lock TOCTOU window while
        keeping every live stateless run out of principal-wide matching.

        All-or-nothing within the single ``_file_lock`` transaction: a contended
        store raises :class:`CronStoreBusy` before any mutation, and a save that
        fails after the mutation puts every touched owner back before re-raising,
        so the cache never reports a release that is not on disk. Returns the ids
        actually released.

        Selects through :meth:`_sync_for_write`, not ``_sync()``, for the reason
        spelled out on :meth:`_remove_jobs_by_owner_locked`: ``_load`` degrades an
        unreadable store to an empty job list, so an ownership scan over it would
        answer "this session owned nothing", skip the save, and report a clean
        release while the still-stamped jobs sit on disk. ``_sync_for_write``
        refuses first, so the caller learns the release did not happen. It also
        fails the liveness read closed, which matters in the opposite direction:
        an empty job list would call every cron principal dead and release jobs a
        live cron still owns.

        * ``list_jobs`` is cache-only, up to one timer-poll interval behind a
          cross-process write — and the cross-process job is precisely what the
          sweep exists to find.
        * ``list_jobs_async`` locks and syncs, but degrades on BOTH store
          failures: :meth:`_synced_snapshot` swallows :class:`CronStoreBusy` and
          returns the cache, and it syncs through ``_sync()``, whose ``_load``
          turns an unreadable store into an empty job list. A contended or
          corrupt store therefore reads as "no owners" — indistinguishable from
          an honestly ownerless store, and the wrong answer for a caller about to
          destroy the last record of an ownership it could not see.

        So this raises instead of degrading: :class:`CronStoreBusy` out of
        :meth:`_file_lock` on sustained contention, :class:`CronStoreUnreadable`
        out of :meth:`_sync_for_write` on a store ``_load`` could not parse. The

        chosen for the same reason spelled out there: ``_sync()`` alone would let
        an unreadable store answer "this session owned nothing".

        Read-only: no mutation, no ``_save``, so nothing to roll back. Returns
        owner keys, not jobs, because the scan's only question is which owner
        spellings exist — the release re-resolves ownership and liveness per job
        inside its own lock, and handing out ``CronJob`` objects would invite a
        caller-side decision on state that is stale the moment the lock drops.

        Unlike :meth:`list_jobs`, which serves the in-memory snapshot that the

        never mutates loop-owned state (``self._jobs``, ``self._last_mtime``) and
        never touches the asyncio timer, so it is safe to invoke from a worker
        thread via ``asyncio.to_thread``.

        This exists specifically for the dashboard status count refresh, which
        needs an enabled-job count off the event loop that is current across
        processes: a job added by the CLI or an MCP tool reaches the snapshot
        only on the next timer tick, while this read sees it at once.

        Enabled semantics come from the shared ``_record_is_enabled`` predicate
        (the single owner used by ``_load`` too): a job is enabled when it is
        neither user-paused nor auto-paused (with the legacy ``!enabled``
        fallback for stores written before those fields existed). A slightly stale count is
        acceptable here — the caller caches it and the atomic tmp→rename write
        in ``_save`` guarantees a concurrent read sees a whole file, never a
        partial one.

        The read, parse and shape guards are :func:`_read_job_records`, shared
        with the other two direct readers. Routing through it is what keeps the
        WS status pusher alive on a corrupt store: catching only
        ``(OSError, json.JSONDecodeError)`` here would let invalid UTF-8
        (``UnicodeDecodeError``, from a bare locale-dependent ``read_text()``)
        and deeply nested JSON (``RecursionError``, a ``RuntimeError``) escape
        and kill the pusher. A count of 0 is the correct degrade: an
        unreadable store has no jobs anyone can schedule.

        The reduction itself lives in :func:`enabled_count_from_disk`, whose
        ``loadable`` half this method deliberately discards — the status pusher
        wants a number it can always render, not a fault to handle.

        unlocked ``self._save()`` directly on the event loop would open a

        ``add_job_async``/``update_job_async`` worker's ``_sync`` and its
        ``_save``, the unlocked save would re-serialize a stale ``self._jobs``

        bounded sync :meth:`_file_lock` (whose spin does ``time.sleep`` and may

        worker's persisted job list is reloaded, then applies the terminal
        fields to the disk copy and ``_save()``s — the whole read-modify-write
        is one lock transaction. Both loop-side callers offload it via
        ``asyncio.to_thread`` so the spin never parks the gateway loop. A
        missing id (removed meanwhile) is a no-op.

        Fenced by run generation like :meth:`_merge_job_result`:
        ``run_generation`` is the number the caller drew for the run this
        record is for, and the record is skipped (debug log, nothing saved)
        when the store already holds a higher one. Both callers release the
        run's claim before they offload this call, so a Run
        accepted in that gap can complete and merge first; applying the older
        record would persist that run's success as the cancellation or timeout
        that came before it. Returning early here skips nothing owed: unlike
        ``_merge_job_result`` this helper writes only the three status fields
        (plus clearing a command/script job's carried result), and the save

        PID. When the newest dump's wedged stack is a cron turn AND exactly one
        abandoned marker carries that PID, that job is the one whose input
        stalled the loop -- and left enabled it is due again as soon as the
        timer arms, which is the hourly crash loop a user reported. It is parked
        ``auto_paused`` with a ``last_error`` that says why and how to resume,
        audited like the failure-count auto-pause. Ambiguous evidence (several
        runs in flight, no marker, a non-cron surface) pauses nothing; the doctor
        prints the same attribution so the operator can decide.

        What the markers said is recorded (``cron_inflight.record_attribution``)
        BEFORE they are swept, because the doctor and the restart notification
        read the same evidence afterwards: an ambiguous verdict the breaker
        declined to act on must still reach the operator who can act on it.

        A dump is CLAIMED, and its markers swept, only once the breaker has
        reached a verdict that survives a restart. A pause the store refused to
        persist leaves the job enabled and still due, so claiming it would let the
        next boot -- the one whose store is readable again -- skip the job and
        re-run the crash the breaker exists to stop. That boot is the only one
        that retries, so it keeps both the claim and the evidence intact.
        Returns the paused job id, or None.

        Every failure here is swallowed. This is a safety net that runs BEFORE
        the timer arms, so a fault in it must cost at most the net: letting one
        propagate would fail ``start()`` and leave the operator with no scheduler
        at all, which is strictly worse than the crash loop it is trying to stop.

        still serializes the loop-side mutators against the ``asyncio.to_thread``
        batch-remove and mutator workers.

        The loop-resident mutator boundaries do NOT call this directly on the
        event loop — they use the ``*_async`` mutator variants (``add_job_async``
        et al.), which offload this lock+save to a worker thread and translate a
        raised :class:`CronStoreBusy` into a clean retryable error. The bounded
        sync path here still serves the CLI/MCP server processes (no event loop
        to park) and remains a strict improvement over the old unbounded flock.

        The ``no-blocking-call-on-event-loop`` invariant is MACHINE-ENFORCED:
        :meth:`_guard_off_event_loop` raises :class:`CronLoopSafetyError` (strict
        mode) or warns (default) if this is entered on a thread with a running
        asyncio loop — so a future writer that calls a sync mutator on the loop
        is caught rather than silently re-freezing it.

        EXHAUSTIVE AUDIT — every ``_sync()`` caller and raw store-``read``
        site in this module, classified by whether it can run on the gateway
        event loop. INVARIANT: **no ``_sync()`` / whole-file ``read_bytes()`` +
        hash ever runs on the loop.** All blocking store I/O is either in a
        worker thread (``asyncio.to_thread``) or in a loop-less process
        (CLI / MCP). Enforced mechanically by
        ``test_cron_locking_regression.py::TestReadPathsLocked`` (on-loop reads
        AND the timer tick must not touch the store on the loop).

        ``_sync()`` callers
          • _persist_add_locked / _update_job_locked_kw / _remove_job_locked /
            _remove_jobs_locked / _enable_job_locked / _ack_job_locked /
            _unack_job_locked  → OFF-LOOP: reached from the loop only via their
            ``*_async`` wrappers, which ``await asyncio.to_thread(...)``; also
            called directly by loop-less CLI/MCP/app-SDK processes.
          • _synced_snapshot  → OFF-LOOP (worker): the body of
            list_jobs_async / get_job_async / run_job's offloaded refresh.
          • _tick_scan_locked  → OFF-LOOP (worker): the timer tick's
            (``_on_timer``) offloaded lock+sync+drain+snapshot transaction.
          • _merge_job_result  → OFF-LOOP on the gateway (``_run_job_isolated``
            calls it via ``asyncio.to_thread``); loop-less CLI/MCP may call it
            directly.
          • run_job  → now OFF-LOOP: its former on-loop ``_sync()`` moved into
            the ``_synced_snapshot`` offload; the claim stays on
            the loop and does NO store I/O.

        Raw store ``read_bytes()`` sites
          • _record_fingerprint (post-load/save) / _sync / _load  → all reached
            only through the OFF-LOOP ``_sync()`` callers above (or a loop-less
            process). None on the loop.
          • initial ``_load()`` (construction / ``start()``)  → the plain
            constructor loads INLINE (loop-less CLI/MCP/apps-SDK/tests only —
            no loop to park). Loop contexts (the gateway) build via the async
            factory ``CronService.create()``, which sets
            ``_defer_initial_load=True`` and runs ``_load()`` via
            ``asyncio.to_thread``; ``start()`` likewise offloads its ``_load()``.
            ``_running`` is False during both, so neither arms a timer off-loop.
            OFF-LOOP on the gateway.

        Cache-only (NO store I/O at all — never lock, read, or hash)
          • list_jobs / get_job  → on-loop hot paths; return the atomically-
            swapped in-memory snapshot.
          • _reaper_loop's ``jobs_by_id`` snapshot  → on-loop; cache-only,
            same atomic-reference-swap rationale as list_jobs.

        "rejected" while the mutation stayed in the in-memory list — a resumed job

        ``_drain_pending_removals_locked``), and the pre-persist snapshot writes
        in ``_force_reap``/``cancel`` (authoritative persist is the offloaded
        ``_merge_terminal_state_locked``).
