"""Full new-path dispatch: TelegramTransport -> TurnDriver -> TelegramRenderer.

``TelegramTransport.receive()`` authorizes + normalizes an inbound update and
hands the ``InboundMessage`` to :meth:`TelegramDispatcher.handle_message`,
which mirrors the Slack transport dispatch:

    command intercept (/new, /compact, /model, /yolo, /help)
    -> construct TelegramRenderer + on_turn_start (immediate ack placeholder)
    -> session acquire -> context build
    -> TurnDriver.run(provider, renderer)   # shared redaction + approval ladder
    -> post-turn (record_success, persist, soft-threshold notice)  # each guarded
    -> renderer.close() + session release   # in finally

``on_callback`` resolves interactive tool approvals (``a:<rid>:<1|0>`` ->
``TelegramApprovalDecider.resolve_global``), applies ``/model`` picks
(``m:<index>``) and re-injects provenance-tagged ``[OPTIONS:]`` choices
(``opt:<index>:<session-tag>``) as literal fresh turns.

Dependency direction is ``telegram -> messaging`` (allowed). The security
``tool_gate`` and spawn auto-approve are wired inline off ``ctx_builder.hooks``
(channel-neutral) so this module never imports ``kiro_crew.slack``.

        together, rather than replaying each as a separate turn.

        The dequeue + receipt flip run together under ``self._queue.lock`` so a
        concurrent mid-turn ``_enqueue_with_receipt`` (which takes the same lock)
        cannot interleave and leave an orphaned receipt. The combined turn itself
        runs OUTSIDE the lock -- messages that arrive during it open a fresh
        receipt and drain after the next turn. Only the queued text is replayed
        (matching what ``enqueue`` persists for DM channels: text only).

        One combined turn gets ONE envelope, so it may only combine messages that
        SHARE one -- same sender, same chat, same Topic. That is
        :attr:`_QueuedOrigin.sender_key`, and it is taken from the FIRST entry this
        iteration collapses, never from the turn that opened the queue: under
        ``dm_scope = "unified"`` one session key, and therefore one queue, is shared
        by every allow-listed person, so a queue holding two of them is reachable on
        the live path. Anything from a different sender or place defers itself and
        everything behind it, so FIFO stays exact and the outer loop drains it next
        as its own turn under its own envelope.

        Which is why this method is given the session key and nothing else: the
        opener's identity is not an input it could accidentally fall back to.

        An entry ANOTHER transport recorded shares this queue under the same scope and
        cannot be answered here at all. It is set aside, and because it has already
        been accepted and receipted, its owner's drain is woken once this pump is done
        -- outside ``self._queue.lock``, since that drain takes its own lock and runs a

        """Post a spawn-approval prompt to the ORIGINATING Telegram conversation.

        Registered into the channel-neutral
        :mod:`~kiro_crew.messaging.spawn_approval_delivery` seam so the single
        host spawn gate can reach the same Approve/Deny/Trust keyboard the
        main-agent tool ladder already uses here. Returns the user's decision
        (``True``/``False``), or ``None`` to tell the gate "not surfaced here,
        fall through to Slack/dashboard" — for a key this dispatcher cannot turn
        back into a chat (``unified`` dm_scope drops the peer, a non-``telegram``
        key, an unparseable one), when the client is not up, when the
        destination's authorization has since been withdrawn, or when the post
        fails. The operator's ``channels`` governance ceiling is read TWICE for
        one prompt, and both reads belong to the seam: before it invokes any hook,
        so a denied channel is never prompted at all, and again through
        ``unpressed_wait_answer`` when a wait elapses unpressed, because a deny
        can land inside that wait. This method owns neither reading; it asks for
        the second one.

        The wait is the SAME deny-by-default one a tool prompt uses
        (:class:`TelegramApprovalDecider`, ``APPROVAL_TIMEOUT_S``): the press
        resolves through the ``on_callback`` ``a:`` branch exactly as a tool
        approval does, so Trust still runs ``add_trusted_session`` and a spawn id
        (``spawn:<agent_id>``) cannot collide with an opaque tool id in the
        registry keyed by ``session_key:request_id``.

        The prompt is armed under ``parent_session_key`` VERBATIM (its ``:genN``
        suffix included), but a press recomputes the key from the LIVE
        conversation (``_callback_session_key``). A generation rotation between the
        spawn and the press — ``/new``, an idle reset, a daily rotation — bumps the
        generation, so the recomputed key does not match the armed one, the press
        resolves nothing, and the prompt deny-by-defaults at the timeout (the user
        sees "already expired"). This mirrors how a mid-run tool prompt behaves
        across a rotation, and it stays a DENY: a rotation is the conversation
        moving on, not a withdrawal of the right to answer. An elapsed wait is a
        fall-through in one case only, when AUTHORIZATION ended during it -- the
        prompt was surfaced, so otherwise ``False`` is a real decision and the gate
        refuses the spawn on it. Two authorities can end authorization mid-wait and
        both are re-read when the wait elapses: this conversation's own
        authorization, which ``on_callback`` checks first for every press with no
        exemption (``_spawn_prompt_destination_permitted``, the same pair consulted
        before posting), and the operator's ``channels`` ceiling, whose reading
        belongs to the seam (``unpressed_wait_answer``) for every channel.

        The allow-list gates who may DRIVE a turn, not who can READ the reply, and a
        forum Topic is readable by the whole supergroup. So a command whose answer
        names state belonging to the host rather than to this conversation -- every
        session on the box, every scheduled job -- would disclose it to members who
        were never allow-listed at all. Same rule `/kirocrew dashboard` follows.

        Scoped to the LISTINGS, and per argument rather than per command. It is not
        "host-wide command" as a category: `/spawn <task>` and `/task run <spec>` act
        on THIS conversation's session and report on their own work, and `/stop` and
        `/compact` are how a forum operator drives the Topic they are in. Refusing
        those would break the forum surface to no benefit, since a caller who can
        reach them already had to be allow-listed.

        But the same command changes scope with its argument, which the command name
        does not show: `/spawn list` renders every subagent on the box with its task
        text, and `/task status` reports the one global runner. `lists_host_state`
        (`messaging/commands.py`) is the answer to that, held next to the functions
        that build those replies -- reading `/spawn <task>` and generalizing to
        `/spawn` is precisely how the listing got through the first time.

        Slack's equivalents have no such shape -- their reply lands in a DM or in a
        thread the caller is already in -- so this is the Telegram-specific half of
        the same rule rather than a divergence from parity.
