"""Transport-agnostic AutoNudge authorization — the security chokepoint.

``authorize_and_add_nudge`` is the SINGLE enforcement point for arming a nudge
loop: dashboard slot ownership, Slack routability, the Discord deny-by-default
allowlist + current-session match, the message-length limit, sensitive
``stop_sentinel_path`` refusal, and the audit-or-deny SEL policy. Every caller
— the ``POST /api/autonudge`` REST handler AND the workflow ``ctx.nudge``
bridge (``dashboard/server.py``) — MUST route through it; none may call
``AutoNudgeService.add`` directly with caller-influenced input.

This lives OUTSIDE ``dashboard/handlers/`` deliberately: the logic is
security-critical and transport-agnostic, so its home is next to the AutoNudge
service (like ``autonudge.binding_key_for``), not inside an HTTP-mapping
module where edits get reviewed as handler cleanup. ``state`` is typed as a
narrow structural Protocol so non-HTTP callers don't need a hard
``DashboardState`` import.

Spec: the AutoNudge section of ``docs/system-specs/modules/learn-cron-dashboard.md``.

    ``absent_ok`` is the one genuine difference between the two callers: on the
    arm path ``None`` means "no banner supplied", while on the update path it
    means "leave unchanged" and is filtered out before we get here, so a ``None``
    reaching this function on that path IS a type error.

    A non-blank banner is credential-scrubbed with the SAME two write-path passes
    the sibling ``message`` field already gets in both authorizers
    (``redact_exfiltration_urls`` then ``redact_credentials``): a banner is
    caller-supplied, PERSISTED to the loop store, and served by
    ``GET /api/autonudge``, so being short does not make it a safe place to park a
    credential. The cap is re-checked AFTER redaction because redaction can GROW
    the string -- ``[REDACTED: credential]`` is 22 chars replacing a 20-char AWS
    key id -- so the first check bounds what we RECEIVE and the second bounds what
    we STORE, keeping the loader from having to blank an over-cap banner later.

    ``truncate`` is for the ONE producer whose banner is derived from arbitrarily
    long text it does not control: ``/goal`` uses the objective as the row. The
    API/MCP callers keep ``truncate=False`` and REJECT an over-cap banner (a user
    typed it and can shorten it). With ``truncate=True`` the over-cap value is not
    rejected but cut to the cap — critically AFTER redaction, never before, so a
    credential straddling the cap boundary is masked while the whole string is
    still present. Slicing first (the caller doing ``objective[:cap]``) would feed
    a truncated token to the scanner, defeat full-token detection, and persist a
    raw credential prefix; redacting the full text first means the cut can only
    land inside plain text or a ``[REDACTED: …]`` placeholder, never a live secret.

    Discord DM must be an allowlisted user's CURRENT session — deny-by-default),
    the 8000-char message limit, and sensitive-``stop_sentinel_path`` refusal.
    ``slot_key`` must already be the resolved binding key (bare ``chat-N-TS`` for
    dashboard, ``slack:``/``discord:`` for channels) — callers that hold a
    namespaced session key map it first (``autonudge.binding_key_for``).
    ``source`` tags the SEL audit (``"dashboard"`` for REST, ``"workflow"`` for
    ctx.nudge).

    SEL AUDIT: emits an event for EVERY outcome — ``denied`` for each
    validation/authorization rejection, ``error`` for a disabled service or an
    ``svc.add`` failure, ``success`` for an armed loop — so an attempted
    cross-session or disallowed nudge always leaves a security audit trail
    (backend-security-controls rule). Never raises for a validation/authz
    failure — returns the ``(error, status)`` so the REST handler can map it to
    an HTTP response and the workflow bridge can log-and-skip.
