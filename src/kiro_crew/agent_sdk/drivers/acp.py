"""The ACP driver's half of the machine-local install question.

The layer above (:mod:`kiro_crew.agent_sdk.backend_install`) owns the *contract*
-- three states, which component a remedy names, how long a verdict is reused.
This module owns the one thing that contract cannot express without reaching
into the harness: whether a spawn of that harness would actually **resolve**
right now.

**It asks through the spawn's own resolvers, never a reimplementation.** A probe
that hand-rolled a PATH search would agree with the spawn only by coincidence:
the resolvers here consult an env override, a project-local ``node_modules``,
mise, and an augmented PATH that includes shims a bare ``shutil.which`` cannot
see. A second search would tell the operator they are ready and then fail the
session, which is a worse outcome than saying nothing.

Install queries return plain data -- a bool, a string, a tuple of bools -- so no
ACP type crosses the boundary. The context bridge additionally returns a narrow
SDK role protocol, never the concrete provider type. Two consequences are deliberate rather than
incidental:

* **A resolver that raises is left to raise.** The failed-CHECK verdict belongs
  to the caller's three-state contract, and swallowing the exception here would
  hand it a ``False`` indistinguishable from an honest "absent" -- which is
  exactly the collapse of ``unknown`` into ``missing`` that contract forbids.
* **The paths themselves are dropped.** Nothing above needs the resolved
  location, and a returned path is a filesystem detail the SDK would then be
  tempted to interpret.

Imports that pull runtime machinery (``kiro_crew.acp`` and
``kiro_crew.sandbox``) are FUNCTION-LOCAL throughout. The ACP package pulls in
the client and runtime, while the sandbox package pulls in platform composition;
this module is reached from a dashboard handler on the boot path, so importing
either at module scope would charge gateway startup for a subsystem used only by
an explicit action. Call-time lookup also lets tests patch the spawn resolver and
sandbox posture at their defining modules.
