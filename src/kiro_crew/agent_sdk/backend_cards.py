"""What each harness can do, projected from the memberships it already declared.

The Developer > Agent Backend switch asks one question this module answers: what
does an operator lose or gain by picking this harness rather than that one? Every
answer here is a PROJECTION over :mod:`kiro_crew.agent_sdk.backends` -- the
capability sets, :data:`~kiro_crew.agent_sdk.backends.ACP_BACKEND_ROUTING`, and
each harness's auth declaration in :mod:`kiro_crew.agent_sdk.host_auth`. Nothing
here is authored per harness, and there is no ``if backend ==`` anywhere in the
file: a harness that joins a set gains its line, and a harness this build has
never heard of renders a complete card the moment its id is in
``ACP_BACKENDS_KNOWN``.

Three levels, and the third one is DECLARED rather than projected
----------------------------------------------------------------
A card line is AVAILABLE, NOT AVAILABLE, or NOT MEASURED. The first two are the
projection, and a ``frozenset`` is why they are only two: it carries one bit -- in,
or out -- so nothing about a non-member is legible in the source data, and three
reasons a reader wants told apart collapse into one absence: cannot do it, does it
differently, and nobody has measured it. ``ACP_BACKENDS_MEMBER_DISPATCH`` shows the
collapse: pi is a non-member because a mount there is INERT (the array is accepted
and never forwarded), deepseek is a non-member on H6 -- it has the mount and, since
Crew's gate plugin, an enforced routing, but no member-dispatch decision has been
taken for that harness -- and KAS is a member on a captured mount.

The third level is NOT derived from the sets, because it is not in them. It is
:data:`DECLARED_UNMEASURED`, a per-harness per-line table carrying a reason per
entry, and it is the one thing in this module authored per harness. That is a
deliberate exception to the rule the rest of the file keeps, taken for the one fact
the rule cannot reach: "nobody has driven this yet" is a statement about Crew's own
EVIDENCE rather than about the harness, it exists today only as prose in a set's
comment, and no bit anywhere carries it. So the alternative to declaring it is not
deriving it: it is a two-level card, where ``ACP_BACKENDS_COMPACT`` excludes pi and
goose for want of a driven capture ("both are unclassified", in the set's own words)
and that exclusion wears the same mark as a harness with no compaction surface at
all. Those two answers are not one answer, and a reader of two levels cannot see
which cell a measurement would pay for.

Five things keep the exception from growing into the per-harness table this
projection exists to remove:

* an entry is admissible ONLY where the deciding set's own comment in ``backends.py``
  says the gap is evidence. ``test_backend_cards`` reads that comment and fails an
  entry the vocabulary does not support, so the table cannot drift away from the
  prose and the threshold is a gate rather than a convention to remember;
* "a decision is missing" is not this state. deepseek has no member dispatch because
  no decision has mounted Crew's control plane into it -- H6 carries nothing over
  from codex's or opencode's -- so the feature does not work there today and
  NOT AVAILABLE is the true mark. Unmeasured is
  for a line whose answer is unknown, never for one whose answer is no;
* an entry may not contradict the projection. A member has demonstrated the
  capability, so :func:`_card_lines` applies an entry only to a line that is already
  not available, and a test fails an entry that names a member rather than letting a
  table overrule a membership;
* it is fail-closed on the wire and counts as neither on the card: ``available`` stays
  a bool and answers False for an unmeasured line, so a consumer reading that field
  alone -- anything predating ``measured`` -- gets the honest not-available answer and
  never a promise;
* a new harness still costs no edit here. Every line of every harness this table does
  not name is measured, so onboarding one renders a complete card exactly as before.

``ACP_BACKENDS_MCP_CONFIG_HOT_RELOAD`` is the near miss worth naming, and it stays
off-card: its answer is KNOWN and version-gated per process, so a pre-session
projection that holds no version cannot answer it in any of the three levels.
Unmeasured would say nobody looked, and somebody did.

The ONE fact that is genuinely graded already carries its own grade:
:class:`~kiro_crew.agent_sdk.backends.Routing` names five mechanisms and one
"not established", each with a documented meaning and a fail-closed default. It is
rendered as data (:attr:`BackendCard.tool_approval`) rather than folded into a
boolean.

Which memberships reach a card, and how
--------------------------------------
Four buckets, and every ``ACP_BACKENDS_*`` set in the vocabulary module reaches at
least one of them (``test_backend_cards`` fails when a new set reaches none, so
adding a set forces the decision rather than defaulting it):

* **user-facing** -- switching harness changes what the user can DO: a control
  appears or disappears, a command is refused, tools are absent from a session, a
  chat cannot be continued. These are :data:`USER_FACING_LINES`, and each is a
  capability whose ABSENCE is a loss, because that is what an available /
  not-available mark means to a reader.
* **security** -- it changes which layer confines the agent, whether Crew hands
  its own credential to the child, or how an unclassifiable approval is answered.
  These are :data:`SECURITY_LINES`. They are stated only when they HOLD and are
  rendered OUTSIDE any disclosure, next to the tool-approval line: "Crew's sandbox
  is not confining this child" is at least as material as how the harness is made
  to ask, and a fact behind a closed disclosure is a fact an operator comparing
  harnesses does not see.
* **operator** -- it says where something LIVES: whose disk holds the transcript,
  which side supplies the model list, which channel carries a command. These are
  :data:`OPERATOR_LINES`, also stated only when they hold, because a caveat is
  either raised or absent -- "this harness does not relocate its home on a pod" is
  not information anyone reads.
* **off-card** -- the only difference the membership makes is which code path
  runs, with the same observable product behaviour when both paths are correct.
  The test for this bucket: if the membership were wrong, would the user see a
  missing feature, or a bug? A wrong ``ACP_BACKENDS_SESSION_SHARING`` costs a user
  ``spawn_continue``. A wrong ``ACP_BACKENDS_SEED_LOCAL_SETTINGS`` is a stale
  model, i.e. a defect. Defects are not capabilities, so they stay off the card --
  see :data:`OFF_CARD_SETS`, which carries the reason per set.

``ACP_BACKENDS_KNOWN`` is in none of the four: it is the membership floor, and a
card existing at all already says it.

A membership whose two states are BOTH fine is a note, never a line. Three sets
are that kind, and each would otherwise put a red cross beside a harness that
loses nothing:

* which side owns the transcript -- Crew holds the kiro family's under its own
  sessions tree, so a reopened chat comes back either way;
* where the model list comes from -- Crew serves the kiro family's ids from its own
  registry;
* which channel carries a slash command -- ``ACP_BACKENDS_KIRO_SLASH_COMMANDS``
  names the ``_kiro.dev/commands/execute`` RPC, and a non-member is not
  command-less: opencode and pi both publish their own built-ins as an
  ``available_commands_update``. Read as "your slash commands stop working" it
  would be false for exactly those two, so the card states the CHANNEL as a note
  and claims nothing about a harness that carries its own.

A set may also inform a line it does not decide alone. Two lines are unions,
because no single set answers the question a user asks; a set that is a union
INPUT is not thereby classified, and no set decides more than one line on its own.

Why the sets are named as STRINGS here
--------------------------------------
Each line names its inputs by set NAME and resolves them through
:func:`_membership`. Two reasons, and the second is a live hazard rather than a
preference:

* it is what lets the completeness test compare what the vocabulary DEFINES
  against what this file classifies. Comparing the frozensets themselves cannot
  do it -- seven of them are equal to ``frozenset({""})`` today, so equality
  proves nothing about which name was meant.
* a value bound at import time does not follow a test that injects a synthetic
  harness by patching the DEFINING module (``test_member_memory_auth`` does
  exactly that). The patch would land on an attribute nothing reads, and the card
  would answer from production membership while the test believed otherwise.

The MCP half, which is a projection over another source
-------------------------------------------------------
One question an operator asks is not answerable from a membership set: what
happens to their AGENT SPEC on the way to this harness. That is declared per
backend in ``providers/mirrors`` -- the projection KIND, the reach of a per-tool
MCP restriction, and a disposition per spec concern -- and
:mod:`kiro_crew.agent_sdk.backend_mcp_ability` projects it. :func:`card_payload`
carries it as its own key so the panel and ``kirocrew doctor`` read one card, while
each projection stays a projection over ONE source.

Why this is not ``SessionCapabilities``, and not in ``backends.py``
------------------------------------------------------------------
:class:`~kiro_crew.agent_sdk.capabilities.SessionCapabilities` answers what one
LIVE session's harness can do, for consumers that must not branch on a harness id.
This module answers what an operator is choosing BETWEEN, before any session
exists, and it is read by exactly one consumer on a request path
(``dashboard/handlers/acp_backend_status``). Keeping them apart is why neither
grows the other's fields.

It cannot live in ``backends.py`` either: the ``vocabulary-home`` ratchet
(``scripts/check_harness_parity.py``, H8) reserves the ``ACP_BACKENDS_*`` spelling
for that module, so a projection over those sets is a function in a module of its
own -- the same shape, and for the same reason, as
``host_auth.backends_retired_by_host_logout()``.

#: A capability the harness's own source says it serves, which no live run has
#: confirmed -- the evidence CLASS the deciding set holds its members to.

#: string so a literal id is illegible, and a renamed constant raises here instead of
#: quietly reading as a harness nobody has.
#:
#: The one entry rests on words in ``ACP_BACKENDS_COMPACT``: pi dispatches
#: ``/compact`` before any model turn in its own source, it could not be driven where
#: that was written (it answers ``Authentication required``), and the set asks for the
#: bar opencode and goose met -- a live session whose ``usage_update.used`` was seen to
#: fall. Until then Crew declines its ``/compact`` with ``COMPACT_ARM_UNCLASSIFIED``,
#: which promises nothing, and this is the card saying the same thing rather than
#: reporting a limit of the harness.
#:
#: USER-FACING lines only, which is not an omission: the security and operator notes
#: are stated only when they HOLD, so an unmeasured one is already absent rather than
#: crossed out, and a third level would have nothing to correct.
