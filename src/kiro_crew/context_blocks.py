"""Classify an assembled agent prompt into the blocks KiroCrew injected.

The assembly in :mod:`kiro_crew.context` appends ~30 separately-sourced strings
into one prompt. Attributing size back to those sources by instrumenting every
append site would put a counter next to each one and drift the moment a new
block is added without its counter. Instead this module classifies the FINAL
string by the bracket markers the assembly already emits — the markers are a
contract with the model, so they are stable, and reading the output means the
attribution cannot disagree with what was actually sent.

Anything not matched lands in ``unclassified``, so a new (or renamed) block
shows up as a visible bucket instead of being silently folded into a neighbour.

Sizes are characters, not tokens. Characters are exact, free, and deterministic;
the only tokenizer available here is OpenAI's BPE, which would add a systematic
unknown error against a Claude backend. For comparing one turn against another —
the point of the breakdown — an exact unit beats an approximate one.

# (``config/prompt.md``) explains ``[RESOURCES]``, ``[Hook context:]``,
# ``[INCOGNITO SESSION]`` and nine more to the model, in backticks — and an
# unanchored scan took each mention for a real block start. Measured on one
# real session: the 38,236-char agent prompt was reported as 438, and its
# remaining 37.8K was booked to ``resource_advisory`` (12,348), ``hook_context``
# (10,374), ``surface``, ``working_folder`` and two session modes that were
# not even on. Anchoring to line start is what makes "the assembly emitted
# this marker" and "the marker matched" the same statement.
#
# ``request_header`` is the one exception: the interactive-guidance paragraphs
# before it end with ``)`` and no newline, so the header legitimately follows
# them on the same line. The hyphenated form the assembly emits is scrubbed out
# of every untrusted source before assembly; a bare ``[CURRENT USER REQUEST]``
# is not, and can still count as a header hit here. That is a pre-existing
# breakdown-only concern (the span the panel trusts comes from the assembly,
# not from this scan), not a boundary-forgery one.
#
# The one seam whose text the assembly does not shape itself -- the caller's
# ``request_prefix_context`` (a ``$skill`` body arrives ``.strip()``ed) -- is

    have all been applied). Pass it whenever it is available: the ``user_chars`` /

    ``user_chars`` is the length of the user's own text as appended (the caller
    knows it exactly; parsing it back out of the prompt would be guesswork
