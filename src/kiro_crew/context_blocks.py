"""Classify an assembled agent prompt into the blocks KiroCrew injected.

The assembly in :mod:`kiro_crew.context` appends ~30 separately-sourced strings
into one prompt. Attributing size back to those sources by instrumenting every
append site would put a counter next to each one and drift the moment a new
block is added without its counter. Instead this module classifies the FINAL
string by the bracket markers the assembly already emits — the markers are a
contract with the model, so they are stable, and reading the output means the
attribution cannot disagree with what was actually sent.

Anything not matched lands in ``unclassified``, so a new (or renamed) block
shows up as a visible bucket instead of being silently folded into a neighbour.

Sizes are characters, not tokens. Characters are exact, free, and deterministic;
the only tokenizer available here is OpenAI's BPE, which would add a systematic
unknown error against a Claude backend. For comparing one turn against another —
the point of the breakdown — an exact unit beats an approximate one.

# (``config/prompt.md``) explains ``[RESOURCES]``, ``[Hook context:]``,
# ``[INCOGNITO SESSION]`` and nine more to the model, in backticks — and an
# unanchored scan took each mention for a real block start. Measured on one
# real session: the 38,236-char agent prompt was reported as 438, and its
# remaining 37.8K was booked to ``resource_advisory`` (12,348), ``hook_context``

# not even on. Anchoring to line start is what makes "the assembly emitted

#
# ``request_header`` is the one exception: the interactive-guidance paragraphs
# before it end with ``)`` and no newline, so the header legitimately follows
# them on the same line. The hyphenated form the assembly emits is scrubbed out
# of every untrusted source before assembly; a bare ``[CURRENT USER REQUEST]``
# is not, and can still count as a header hit here. That is a pre-existing
# breakdown-only concern (the span the panel trusts comes from the assembly,
# not from this scan), not a boundary-forgery one.
#

    ``prompt``, as reported by ``build_message`` (which is the only code that sees
    the turn after a rewriting hook, marker neutralization and the multibyte fold
    have all been applied). Pass it whenever it is available: the ``user_chars`` /
    ``user_offset`` pair below reconstructs the same span from pre-transform
    lengths, which drifts whenever the assembly grows another transform.

    ``user_chars`` is the length of the user's own text as appended (the caller
    knows it exactly; parsing it back out of the prompt would be guesswork
    because the text is neutralized, not delimited). It is subtracted from the
    request-header span, which is the block the user's text sits inside.

    ``user_offset`` is how many characters sit BETWEEN the request-header line
    and the user's text — the length of any context the caller prepended into
    the message region (a cancelled-turn preamble, subagent-failure notices,
    drained pending context). Those bytes are injected context, not user typing,
    so the user span starts ``user_offset`` chars in rather than flush against
    the header; the prepended context keeps its own attribution.

    Returns a label -> characters mapping (UTF-8 bytes with ``utf8_bytes=True``).
    Span coordinates always remain characters; use an authoritative ``user_span``
    for exact byte attribution. No tokenizer or provider serialization is involved.
    Zero-length blocks are omitted. Every character of ``prompt`` is accounted for
    exactly once, so the values sum to ``len(prompt)`` — a property the tests
    assert, and the reason ``unclassified`` exists rather than a silent drop.

    The sizes are the sums of :func:`block_spans`: the usage rows' per-turn sizes
    and the developer prompt view's ordered spans come from the same scan
    FUNCTION, so both find a boundary the same way. Their inputs may legitimately
    differ — the usage row scans the assembled prompt at its announced user span,
    the prompt view scans the text as sent (receipt-substituted, capped, and
    uncarved when no span was announced) — so the two can differ in what they
