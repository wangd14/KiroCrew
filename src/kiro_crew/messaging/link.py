    """Re-bind a conversation as its own mirror LOCATION and shape the link reply.

    The in-channel ``/link``, and the exact counterpart of
    :func:`release_conversation_location`: that one frees the location and returns
    the unlink reply, this one claims it and returns the link reply. Mirroring is
    automatic (:func:`bind_origin_mirror` re-asserts it on every turn), so this is
    the WITHDRAWAL of a previous unlink rather than the only way to turn it on --
    which makes clearing the opt-out the load-bearing half, since rebinding
    without it is undone by the next automatic bind check.

    *location* must be the channel's single definition of "this conversation", the
    same value handed to :func:`bind_origin_mirror` and
    :func:`release_conversation_location`, because the release matches an occupied
    location by VALUE. *unlink_command* is how the channel spells its own unlink
    in chat (``/unlink``, ``` `!unlink` ```), the only per-channel part of the
    reply.

    One write for the whole sequence: each of these mutations would otherwise
    rewrite the entire session map, stalling the event loop three times for what
    is one user-visible action.

    **The claim goes FIRST inside the batch.** ``batched_save`` writes on the way
    out even when the block raises, so a refusal raised after the opt-out
    withdrawal would PERSIST that withdrawal for a link that never happened --
    silently turning mirroring back on. ``set_mirror_link`` refuses before it
    mutates anything, so ordering it first leaves the batch clean and nothing is
    written.

    Raises ``ConversationOwnershipConflict`` (by that type, from
    ``session_map``) when an inbound-committed occupant holds the location. It is
    deliberately NOT caught here: a channel whose transport declares
    ``supports_session_resume`` has a conversation-specific instruction to give

def bind_origin_mirror(sessions: Any, *, key: str, location: ChannelLink) -> bool:
    """Bind the conversation a session is being READ in as its own outbound mirror.

    The in-channel counterpart of :func:`release_conversation_location`, shared by
    the DM dispatchers and called from the inbound turn path. A channel
    conversation IS its own mirror: the person reading the chat is the audience
    for every turn of that session, including the turns they later take from the
    dashboard. Slack has always stamped its own thread on every inbound turn and
    ``SessionMap.get_mirror_link`` synthesizes a mirror from that binding, so a
    dashboard turn on a Slack conversation has always reached Slack. A channel
    that writes the binding only from its explicit link command reaches nobody:
    ``_resolve_mirror_target`` finds no link for that channel and the chat sits
    there looking dead while the conversation continues elsewhere.

    Re-asserted on EVERY turn rather than only on a new session, because the
    binding is what a restart-cold session, an unlink at this location by another
    session, or a rival claim can take away — and only a self-healing bind cannot
    leave a live conversation silently unmirrored. Those all REMOVE a binding;
    none of them repoints one. So ANY binding already present is deliberate and is
    left alone — whichever conversation and whichever CHANNEL it names. The
    dashboard can point a session's mirror at any surface, so a channel
    conversation whose owner aimed it elsewhere keeps that target; overwriting it
    would silently redirect their replies into this chat. The threadless Slack row
    the first turn's ``set_channel`` leaves in the legacy field is not a binding
    and never reads back as one: ``SessionMap.get_mirror_link`` filters it at the
    source, so this reader sees ``None`` for a conversation nobody has bound.

    Honours the persisted opt-out the in-channel unlink writes: without it, "off"
    would last exactly until the user's next message, because an entry with no
    binding is indistinguishable from one that was never linked. Declining is ALL
    the opt-out does here — this never clears a binding it finds, so an explicit
    dashboard link to a different target survives it.

    *location* is the single definition of "this conversation", carrying whatever
    thread/topic scoping the channel needs; the same value must be handed to
    :func:`release_conversation_location`, which matches an occupied location by
    VALUE, so a second spelling would let the release miss the binding this wrote.

    Skipped entirely when *key* does not identify ONE conversation.
    ``dm_scope="unified"`` collapses every allowed user's direct DMs into a single
    ``unified:{agent}`` bucket — the channel and the user drop out of the key — so
    "the origin conversation" has no single answer, and a mirror bound there would
    deliver one user's dashboard replies into another user's chat. The test reads
    the KEY rather than each channel's config, because the key is what the binding
    hangs off: a config-derived check in each dispatcher could disagree with the
    key actually in use, and one written per channel would have to be got right
    again every time. A forum/thread route keeps its full bucket under any scope,
    so it is unaffected, and the explicit in-channel link stays available — it
    names the conversation the user is actually in.

    Returns True iff a binding was written. Skipping is a no-op, and the steady
    state is a READ: ``SessionMap`` rewrites the whole map per mutation on the
    event loop, so a per-turn write would put that stall on the repeating path.

    Never raises. This runs on the turn path, where an uncaught raise drops the
    turn and answers the user nothing. ``ConversationOwnershipConflict`` is the
    reachable one: a transport declaring
    ``TransportCapabilities.supports_session_resume`` makes its conversations
    inbound-committable, so an inbound-committed occupant refuses this claim. A
    dispatcher that routes such a conversation to its occupant instead skips the
    bind entirely — but its resolver fails CLOSED on duplicate inbound bindings
    (ambiguous routing is denied), and that is precisely the state where the turn
    path reaches this bind and the claim is refused. It is caught by type rather
    than by name because ``session_map`` imports this module, so naming the
    exception here would be an import cycle.
