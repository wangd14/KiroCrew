"""The ownership contract for a mid-turn queue shared by several transports.

Why a shared module exists at all, when ``_handle_busy`` and ``_drain_queue``
deliberately stay per-channel: one mid-turn queue can hold entries from more than one
TRANSPORT. Every DM dispatcher is constructed with the orchestrator's single
``SessionManager``, and under ``messaging.dm_scope = "unified"``
``build_dm_session_key`` reduces a direct chat's bucket to ``unified:{agent}``,
dropping the CHANNEL as well as the user. So a Telegram DM and a Discord DM to the
same agent resolve to one session key, and therefore one queue.

Three things therefore cannot live in any one channel's module.

The first is the ownership predicate. A drain can only answer the entries its OWN
channel recorded, because an entry from another transport carries no address it can
reach: the origin fields are channel-specific, so :data:`QUEUED_CHANNEL_KEY` is the
one field every drain can read on every entry. Four channels drain this queue
(telegram, discord, teams, webex) and a fifth is a plausible addition, so the key and
its reader are defined ONCE here rather than restated per module. A restated literal
is a silent failure: one typo makes that channel's entries "not mine" to every drain,
including its own, so they are unowned and stranded with nothing raising.

The second is WHOSE each entry is. ``/stop`` cancels one person's turn, so it may drop
only that person's queued messages; under a unified scope the rest of the queue belongs
to other people who are still waiting for an answer. Naming the principal takes the same
neutral treatment as naming the channel and for a stronger reason: the caller has to
compare every entry on the queue, including entries another transport recorded whose
channel-specific fields it cannot read at all. So :data:`QUEUED_OWNER_KEY` and
:func:`owner_token` live here too.

The third is the wake. An entry set aside has already been accepted and receipted, so
something must come back for it. Nothing did: a drain runs only from the tail of its
own channel's turn, so a cross-transport entry waited for that transport to finish some
unrelated turn, and waited forever if it went quiet.

The registry holds channels, not addresses. It maps a channel type to "drain this
session key", which is all a waker needs to know about a peer; every conversation id,
chat id, room id and thread stays inside the channel that owns it, the same boundary
``messaging/queue_receipt.py`` keeps for the receipt.

#: await -- so an entry arriving in that window is set aside by the peer running under
#: that await, and the refused wake was the only thing that would have come back for
