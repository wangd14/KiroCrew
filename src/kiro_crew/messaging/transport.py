class TransportCapabilities:
    """What a messaging channel can do.

    HONESTY CONTRACT. A declaration here is a claim other code is entitled to
    trust, so every field carries its real enforcement status below and
    ``test/test_capability_ledger.py`` forces any new field to be classified.
    History: several flags drifted into being false (a channel declaring
    ``threads=False`` while threading end to end; a ``max_buttons`` cap no
    renderer applied; docstrings describing gates that did not exist). Declare
    what the CODE does today — not the platform ceiling, and not intent.

    ENFORCED (something behaves differently when the value changes):

    * ``max_message_chars`` — the cross-surface mirror leg chunks on it
      (``dashboard/chat_runner.py``) and five renderers size their own chunks
      from it. This is a CHARACTER count.
    * ``max_message_bytes`` — the same limit measured in UTF-8 BYTES, for a
      platform whose cap is bytes (Webex: 7439). ``0`` means "not byte-capped".
      A char count cannot express a byte cap safely: the only sound char value is
      the byte budget divided by four (the worst case), which fragments every
      ASCII reply into quarters. So a byte-capped transport declares BOTH — the
      char value stays as the safe floor for a caller that can only count chars,
      and this is what a caller that can measure bytes uses instead.
    * ``supports_proactive_send`` — gates mirror-link creation (HTTP 400) and
      the outbound mirror leg (skipped).
    * ``supports_session_resume`` — gates whether connecting a channel from the
      dashboard marks the binding as an INBOUND resume target
      (``accepts_inbound``), and therefore whether the slot row reports
      ``direction: both``. Only a transport whose inbound path actually resolves
      the mirror binding may declare it: Discord and Telegram both resolve the
      conversation through their channel-specific session-resume adapters. The
      remaining transports derive a session key from the route alone and never
      consult the binding. Declaring it where it is not honoured makes the
      dashboard promise a two-way link whose replies silently start a separate
      session — which is exactly what this flag exists to prevent. The dashboard
      then calls ``may_resume_from`` on the resolved target, so a capable transport
      may still narrow inbound ownership per conversation. Slack is out of scope
      here: it routes inbound through its own ``_thread_to_session`` index and
      never sets the marker.

    * ``max_buttons`` — TOTAL interactive choices a renderer may present for
      one ``[OPTIONS:]`` trailer (not a per-row layout number — row packing
      stays channel-internal). Widget-capable renderers route the parsed
      list through ``messaging.renderer.apply_options_cap``, which keeps the
      first N for the widget and degrades the remainder to a numbered text
      list in the body. Channels declaring 0 render no widget and route the
      WHOLE list through ``messaging.renderer.render_options_as_text``, which is
      the same helper with zero widget slots, so every choice arrives as a
      numbered line rather than being deleted with the trailer. WhatsApp is the
      one zero-widget channel that does NOT do this: its renderer strips a
      complete trailer (``whatsapp/turn_renderer.py::_strip_options``) and the
      choices are lost. Do not read a 0 here as a promise that the list survives
      -- ``test_options_cap_contract.py`` drives the four channels that honour it,
      and WhatsApp is deliberately absent from that set.

    * ``rich_blocks`` — gates whether a renderer attaches a native widget at
      all. Webex reads it before building an Adaptive Card, for both the
      tool-approval prompt (``on_prompt_choice``) and an ``[OPTIONS:]`` trailer
      (``_options_card``). A channel declaring ``False`` keeps the numbered-text
      and typed-reply forms, which work everywhere — so the flag decides whether
      a widget APPEARS, never whether the user can answer.

    * ``mention_grammars`` — whether the platform parses a broadcast-mention
      grammar (``@everyone``, Slack's ``<!channel>``) in a message body.
      ``messaging.renderer.display_safe_for`` reads it at the channel-NEUTRAL
      proactive sinks and applies the zero-width-space defang only where one
      exists. Default True, because the failure directions are asymmetric: a
      needless defang mangles text cosmetically, a missing one lets a
      prompt-injected ``@everyone`` mass-notify. Webex declares False — it has no
      broadcast grammar and its allow-list IS email addresses, so the defang makes
      every address the agent prints uncopyable.

    * ``files_outbound`` — gates whether a renderer pulls local image
      references out of a sealed segment and uploads them. Discord's renderer
      reads it before running ``messaging.outbound_files`` extraction, so a
      channel declaring ``False`` keeps printing the markdown path (the honest
      degradation) instead of silently dropping the picture. Split from
      ``files_inbound`` because one boolean was undecidable: the two directions
      land per channel and in different changes — Weixin ingests CDN media
      today with no upload half written.

    * ``table_mode`` — the per-target table presentation policy: ``off`` /
      ``cards`` / ``grid`` / ``native`` / ``auto``. Renderers read this field
      at the outbound boundary, so the same canonical turn may stay native on
      one target and become cards on another. ``off`` is the conservative
      default: a transport opts in only when its renderer applies the shared
      table transform or already owns an equivalent conversion.

    * ``native_tables`` — whether the target renders a GFM pipe table AS a
      table. ``messaging.tables.resolve_table_policy`` checks it, so
      ``table_mode=native`` passes through only where the capability is true
      and safely becomes cards otherwise. Claiming native support wrongly ships
      literal pipes, which is the output the conversion exists to prevent.
      Slack is deliberately false — it renders no table, and its own flattening
      in ``slack/format.py`` predates this.

    ASPIRATIONAL (declared, honest, but nothing reads them yet — the
    capability-gated interface work will consume them; do NOT write code that
    assumes they are enforced):

    * ``streaming``, ``edit``, ``reactions``, ``threads``
    * ``files_inbound`` — the transport ingests user attachments into the turn.

    Defaults are deliberately conservative (the WhatsApp-like floor) so a
    transport that forgets to declare a capability degrades safely rather
    than over-promising.

        absent, or it would refuse every group and unified-scope send.

        A transport whose conversation id already IS the roster identity (Telegram,
