"""Channel-neutral halves of the chat commands every DM channel ships.

A channel dispatcher's command handler is two things welded together: a decision
(what the grant becomes, whether a turn was actually cancelled, how long a login
link lives, what a cron listing says) and a send (which needs a ``chat_id``, a
``channel_id``, or a ``(conversation_id, serviceUrl)`` pair). The decision half is
identical across channels and this module owns it; only the send stays behind.

Two families landed here from opposite directions and both belong: the
**stateful** commands whose decision is a side effect on shared state
(``/stop``'s cooperative cancel, ``/yolo``'s grant ladder, the dashboard-link TTL
vocabulary), and the **path-independent** keyword commands whose answer is one
string computed from a service (``spawn``, ``cron``, ``task run``). They share the
same contract, so they share the same module rather than splitting on a
distinction no caller observes.

What lives here and what does NOT:

* HERE -- the decision plus the reply TEXT, the same shape
  :func:`~kiro_crew.messaging.link.release_conversation_location` already uses for
  ``/unlink``, so the user-facing strings have exactly one owner. Each
  keyword-command function is ``(text, service) -> reply | None``, where ``None``
  means the text is not that command and normal routing continues.
* NOT here -- anything address-shaped. Nothing below accepts a chat id, a thread
  or a service URL; ``/stop`` reaches its receipt bubble through the
  already-bound :class:`~kiro_crew.messaging.queue_receipt.ReceiptSurface`, which
  is what keeps Telegram's forum routing and Teams' service URLs channel-local.
* NOT here -- the command GRAMMAR. Which token a channel spells a command with,
  and how many words precede an argument, stays in that channel's own
  ``commands.py``; the functions below take an already-extracted argument.

**Services are duck-typed on purpose.** ``kiro_crew.subagent`` and
``kiro_crew.taskrunner`` both reach ``kiro_crew.slack`` transitively, so importing
them at runtime here would reintroduce the ``messaging -> slack`` edge the
abstraction exists to remove. They are typed under ``TYPE_CHECKING`` and consumed
through the handful of attributes named at each call.

Dependency direction is ``<channel> -> messaging`` (never the reverse), and this
module additionally imports nothing from ``kiro_crew.dashboard`` -- see
:func:`parse_dashboard_ttl` for the one place that constrains a signature.

    :func:`kiro_crew.messaging.queue_drain.owner_token` builds for the person who typed
    the command, and only entries carrying it are dropped. Under
    ``messaging.dm_scope = "unified"`` ``build_dm_session_key`` reduces a direct chat's
    bucket to ``unified:{agent}``, dropping the channel and the user, so every
    allow-listed person's DM on every transport resolves to one key and one queue: a
    whole-queue clear here discards messages other people sent and are still owed an
    answer to, and flips their receipt to a cancellation they never asked for. The
    argument is REQUIRED, with no default, so a channel wired up later cannot inherit
    that by leaving it out; a channel that genuinely cannot name its principal passes
    ``""``, which clears nothing rather than everything.

    The RUNNING turn is still cancelled whoever it belongs to, which is what the caller
    asked for and what every transport's Stop has always done. Telling one person's turn
    from another's is not possible from here: a session records the asyncio task holding
    it, not the sender the task is answering.

    **The cancel is cooperative before it is fatal.** ``cancel(wait_ack_timeout=0)``
    writes an ACP ``session/cancel`` notification and returns without waiting, so
    the acknowledgement to the user is immediate and the turn stops at its next
    safe point. On a shared runtime that is the only path that cannot take a
    co-tenant process down with it. ``cancel`` is probed with ``getattr`` because
    a provider that predates the ext-method simply does not offer one, and a
    missing cancel must degrade to "queue cleared" rather than raise at the user.

    ``clear_queue`` and the receipt finalize run under a SINGLE hold of
    :attr:`ReceiptQueue.lock`, which is the same hold the end-of-turn drain takes
    across its dequeue plus flip. Splitting them would let a drain observe a
    queue already emptied while its receipt bubble still said "⏳ Queued",
    orphaning the bubble as the durable record of a burst that was cancelled.

    A cancel that raises is logged and reported as "nothing was running": the
    queue is still cleared, so claiming a stop that did not happen would be the
