"""A ceiling on how many turns one chat conversation can drive.

The loss this closes
--------------------
A chat channel can be made to answer itself: the agent replies, the reply
arrives back as inbound, the agent answers it, and that repeats without end at
one real model turn per cycle. Each channel that has met this ships a
per-message echo guard, and every one of those guards recognises a SHAPE -- an
exact body match inside a short TTL, or a remembered message id. A guard that
recognises a shape fails open on the variant it does not recognise, and the loop
then runs again at full cost with nothing on any surface saying so.

This module bounds the COST of that class instead of recognising its members, so
an echo variant no guard knows is still bounded.

Why a count over a long window, and not a rate
----------------------------------------------
A loop's rate is set by how long a turn takes, which puts it in the same band as
a person firing off quick notes: very roughly three to twelve messages a minute.
Any threshold tight enough to catch a slow loop also refuses a real person, and
on a chat channel a refusal the user cannot see is silence. Over an hour the two
populations separate: a loop sustains a hundred and eighty turns or more, while
a fast human in a busy thread stays in the tens. So the bound is a COUNT over a
long window, and it needs no rate threshold at all.

Why it never asks who sent the message
--------------------------------------
In a self-chat a channel cannot tell its own message from the peer's, which is
the same limit the per-message guards run into. This ceiling does not ask. It
counts turns in a conversation, so a loop and a very busy human are bounded by
one rule and neither has to be identified.

Why the ceiling LATCHES
-----------------------
A rolling window on its own lets a loop resume the moment the window slides,
which bounds the burn rate but never ends it. So the first refusal latches the
conversation, and every later turn on that key is refused until the latch clears.

Why the session key is the right key, and what clears a latch
------------------------------------------------------------
The gate this composes into already receives the session key, so keying on it
adds no identity plumbing to any channel.

Resetting the conversation clears a latch, and every verb the product calls a
reset does it: the session lifecycle's conversation discard, ``remove``,
``remove_if_unclaimed`` and ``destroy`` all release the key they act on. That is
the resume path, it is what the refusal text names, and it is reachable from the
dashboard -- Slack's ``!agent default`` reaches ``remove`` and answers "Reset to
default agent", so a latch surviving it would refuse the first message of a
conversation the user was just told had been reset. A gateway restart clears one
too, because the store is in memory.

A loop reaches none of them. It cannot reset its own conversation, and a restart ends
it anyway. The channel key itself does NOT change on a discard -- channel linkage
is retained by design -- so the explicit reset, not a key change, is what makes
the documented remedy work, and a test pins that the reset releases a latched
conversation.

Why the refusal names no resume command
---------------------------------------
In a self-chat the text the agent emits is exactly what comes back as inbound.
A refusal that quoted the command for resuming would hand the loop its own way
out, so the message describes the resume surface and quotes no command for it.

Why this is not enforced inside the session gate itself
------------------------------------------------------
The dashboard calls the same ``begin_turn`` gate, and it drives turns a human is
watching and clicking through. Composing at the channel turn sites keeps the
ceiling on inbound chat traffic and off dashboard, cron and subagent turns.

Why a monitor turn is not counted
---------------------------------
Two of the channel turn sites are the arm that drives an armed monitor loop, not
an inbound message. A monitor already carries its own cycle cap and its own
runtime budget, so it is bounded by construction, and counting its cycles here
would let a legitimately armed long watch latch the conversation and then refuse
the human's next message in it. The ceiling therefore composes onto the inbound
arm only, and a test names every site so a new one has to be classified on
purpose rather than inherit a default.

Bounding the bookkeeping
------------------------
The store is in memory and holds two bounded maps: one timestamp window per
tracked conversation and one latch set. Both are newest-wins and capped at
:data:`MAX_TRACKED_CONVERSATIONS`, so a host meeting many conversations cannot
turn a loop guard into a memory leak. In memory is deliberate: a loop is a live
phenomenon, a restart ends it, and a restart is also the one event after which a
latch should not survive.

#: The ceiling bounds a conversation that keeps driving itself, and what makes
#: that runaway unbounded is that each turn's own output arrives as the next
#: inbound message. A turn an armed nudge loop generates is not that: the loop
#: carries its own cycle cap and runtime budget, so its cycles are already
#: bounded and counting them here would let a long legitimate watch spend the
#: conversation's budget and then latch it -- refusing both its own next cycle
#: and the human's next message.
#:
#: SINGLE-USE, which is the whole safety property. A dispatcher drains the
#: messages queued during a turn from that turn's own tail, in the same task, so
#: a span-wide exemption would also exempt every drained INBOUND message -- and
#: the drain pump keeps answering whatever each drained turn queues next, which
#: is precisely the unbounded self-driving loop this module exists to bound. One
#: generated turn therefore buys exactly one uncounted gate; everything nested
#: inside it, or after it, is counted like any other inbound turn.
#:
#: Context-local rather than a parameter because the only code that KNOWS a turn
#: is generated is the nudge dispatcher, and between it and this gate sit several
#: channels' ``handle_message`` signatures that have no business carrying the

#: human turn in another task is unaffected, which a module-global flag would not

    Dispatching the chunk shows the pause on the surface where it happened, which
    is the half the per-message echo guards do not have: their drop is silent.
    ``on_done`` is the other half, and it is required rather than tidy. A
    channel's ``finally`` calls ``close()``, which tears the turn down -- cancels
    timers, finalizes the reaction -- and flushes nothing, while a throttled
    stream holds the chunk's trailing word back so the two halves of a word cut
    across fragments cannot be appended separately. On the refusal path no
    further chunk is coming, so without this the notice is appended one word
    short and the stream is never sealed. The ceiling latches, so every later
    turn in that conversation would repeat the same truncated notice.

    Says nothing at all unless ``exc.announce`` -- see
    :class:`TurnCeilingExceeded` for why a notice on every refusal would answer
    its own reflection forever.

    This is what the shared dispatcher's sibling memory-refusal branch does with
    the same two calls, and ``on_done`` is idempotent under the ``close()`` that
    follows it in the ``finally``.
