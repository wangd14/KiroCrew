"""push_guard.py - pre-push stale-base guard for the prepare-pr skill.

Verifies that the current HEAD is safe to force-push by checking:
1. The fetch of origin/<base> succeeds (fail closed on network error).
2. origin/<base> is an ancestor of HEAD (i.e. HEAD sits on the freshly
   fetched base tip, not on a stale fork point that would cause the squash
   to bake in reversions of newer base changes).
3. The number of commits HEAD is ahead of origin/<base> is plausibly small
   (default threshold: 5 commits for a single-commit PR workflow; configurable
   via --max-ahead).
4. None of the ahead-commits are patch-equivalent to commits in a bounded
   window (REPLAY_HISTORY_WINDOW) of origin/<base> history.  Comparison uses
   `git patch-id --stable` so renames, whitespace, and commit metadata are
   ignored — only the semantic diff matters.  The window is bounded because
   full history is unbounded cost, and replayed commits from a recent stale
   fork are by construction recent.

This prevents the catastrophic failure mode where a worktree branched from a
local integration trunk (kiki-trunk) carries 100+ unshipped commits that get
force-pushed to the remote feature branch, clobbering upstream work.

Portable: stdlib only; shells out to git via argument lists.

Usage:  python3 push_guard.py [--base <branch>] [--max-ahead <N>]
Exit:   0 SAFE | 40 REFUSED (stale base detected) | 2 environment error
