"""``kirocrew desktop`` -- read the Electron app's debug metrics artifact.

Why this is a reader and not a query: ``app.getAppMetrics()`` is an Electron-main
API, readable only from inside that process. This CLI is a separate Python
process, and a second Electron instance cannot see the first one's metrics, so
there is no way to ask the running app for a live sample without adding a
listener to it. Rather than open one, ``website/electron/perf-metrics.js`` records
a bounded rolling artifact and this command reads it.

The consequence worth stating plainly: the numbers here are the most recent
samples the app wrote, not an instant captured on demand. If the app is not
running with ``KIROCREW_DEBUG`` set, there is no artifact at all.

Debug-only, and gated by the same ``KIROCREW_DEBUG`` check as ``kirocrew perf``.
