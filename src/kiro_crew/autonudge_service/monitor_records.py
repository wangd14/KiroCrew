"""The structured-monitor transitions the typed controller drives.

Each transition stages a copy of the loop, persists the complete replacement snapshot
while holding the service lock, and only then publishes it onto the live object, so a
restart can never restore state a reader was not shown or the reverse. The accepted-
turn correlation bounds a terminal record's wake claim until completion evidence
arrives or its window expires, and a replacement whose trust grant is still being
authorized keeps the prior row restorable until it commits.

Its functions are :class:`~kiro_crew.autonudge.AutoNudgeService` methods: each is bound
on the class by name and runs against the service's state through ``self``, and a call
to any other service method goes through ``self`` too, so a patch on the instance
reaches it.
