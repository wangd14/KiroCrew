    One function, because the answer is needed in five places -- the arm, the
    retarget, the tick's probe config, the rebinding check that runs after the poll,
    and the terminal revalidation -- and a subject decided differently in any one of
    them is a loop whose monitor and whose reader disagree about what is watched.

    The brief's ``targets`` list is read FIRST because
    :func:`~kiro_crew.autonudge_judge.parse_targets` already reads it first: a list
    NARROWS the watch, and once it is present the collector asks about those strings
    and nothing else. A monitor resolved from the instruction while the collector
    asks about the list is two halves about two pull requests, and the reading is
    dropped every tick as "a pull request this loop does not watch".

    That is not hypothetical. A loop armed with the URL in ``judge.targets`` and the
    number alone in its instruction got NO monitor: nothing was fetched, the tick
    recorded no evidence, and every interval fired on the plain timer -- so the
    comment bodies the judge exists to read never reached it.

    The instruction decides when the brief names no pull request, which is the
    ordinary case and the one this inference was built for. It also decides when the
    brief names MORE than one: a loop holds a single monitor, so a list of two
    subjects selects none, and falling back leaves such a loop exactly the reading it
    gets today rather than taking its monitor away.

    The brief reading FIRST is a precedence, never an override. It supplies the
    subject only when the instruction names NO pull request in any of this module's
    grammars -- the case this inference exists for. Once the instruction names one,
    the instruction decides, which is what this module answered before the brief was
    read at all: for a one-subject instruction that is its own pull request, and for
    a shorthand-only or two-subject instruction it is ``None``.

    Falling back rather than refusing, because refusing would SUBTRACT. For the
    ordinary "blocked on #7" shape -- instruction names its own pull request, brief
    names the blocker -- base bound a monitor on the instruction's pull request,
    polled it and retired the loop when it merged; only the judge's collector dropped
    that reading. Answering ``None`` would take merge-retirement away from loops that
    already have it, stored ones included, and the brief-only fix does not need it.

    The GRAMMAR is unchanged and stays in one place. Every candidate goes through
    :func:`targets.infer`, whose refusal of a shorthand has nothing to do with where
    the text came from -- ``#123`` is equally an issue reference, and a slug carries
    no host -- so a brief naming ``owner/name#123`` selects nothing here, exactly as
    the collector drops that entry.
