"""The legacy loop transactions: arm, update, deactivate and remove.

Every transaction snapshots under the service lock, writes on a worker thread and
treats the rename as its commit point: a failed write restores the prior live loop and
timer, a removal restores its row for an immediate retry. A caller cancelled mid-write
leaves the shielded inner task holding the lock until the executor write settles.
Provider-credential denial is made durable before an agent-writable row can disappear,
and the self-arm trust entry is revoked only after the store committed the removal.

Its functions are :class:`~kiro_crew.autonudge.AutoNudgeService` methods: each is bound
on the class by name and runs against the service's state through ``self``, and a call
to any other service method goes through ``self`` too, so a patch on the instance
reaches it.
