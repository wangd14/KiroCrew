"""The per-loop timer tasks, the turn-lifecycle hooks that arm them, and the reconciler.

One cancellation policy (:func:`_cancel_timer`) retires a loop's timer task, and one
arming rule (:func:`_arm_from_deadline`) re-arms it toward the loop's persisted
deadline, so a user turn defers a pending fire without pushing the schedule back. The
dashboard's turn hooks (``notify_*``) are the reactive half: they cancel on user input,
resume on turn completion and record approval and start-failure evidence for the next
tick to act on, deferring around a loop's fire window. The reconciler is the backstop
that re-arms an active loop left with no live timer across two passes.

Its functions that take the service as ``self`` are
:class:`~kiro_crew.autonudge.AutoNudgeService` methods: each is bound on the class by
name and runs against the service's state through ``self``, and a call to any other
service method goes through ``self`` too, so a patch on the instance reaches it. The
plain helpers beside them are imported directly by the owners that use them.

    a just-delivered fire, a legacy store entry) starts a fresh full
    countdown from now, and the assignment is persisted through a
    supervised background write so a restart resumes this countdown

    An overdue deadline waits for the smaller of ``_OVERDUE_REARM_SECS``

    injecting the raw message every interval with no decision at all. The
    refusal is deliberately made HERE, on the arm, rather than by rewriting
    the record: the stored ``active`` intent belongs to the gateway that
    wrote it and must survive the downgrade so an upgrade resumes the watch.

      window has to end somewhere, and the fire path's busy-slot refusal
      (plus its backoff) keeps a rescue that guessed wrong from ever
      delivering into the running turn; the wasted attempt is the cost of
      rescuing the turn that died silently, which looks identical from
      here.
    * A loop inside another coroutine's mutation window. ``update()``
      mutates fields, awaits an offloaded store write, and ROLLS BACK the
      fields if the write fails -- a single-pass reconciler could arm the
      transiently-active shape and leave a rolled-back inactive loop with
      a live timer. Two passes shrink that window, but the write has no
      timeout, so the guard that CLOSES it is the lock check below: every
      mutation runs inside ``self._lock``, this pass is synchronous, and
      a pass that finds the lock held defers entirely.

    Deliberately never touched, whatever the passes observe:

    * A loop mid-fire (``_firing``): its running task must never be
      cancelled (see ``update``), and ``_arm_timer`` cancels before it
      creates. The fire window owns its own re-arm bookkeeping.
    * A loop quiesced by administrative cleanup: cleanup owns it.
    * A monitor record whose version this gateway does not implement:
      ``_arm_from_deadline`` refuses those with an INFO line, and letting
      the reconciler retry it would repeat that line every pass forever.
    * A monitor whose wake claim is in flight with NO completion-evidence
      deadline -- EXCEPT a ``BUSY`` retry. The no-deadline shape is a
      claim that died mid-handoff: ``_load`` retires it on restart, and
      arming it here would wake a controller that answers ``NO_CHANGE``
      forever (the probe path is never reached, so no budget or cap can
      end it) -- an unretirable zombie dressed as a rescue. A ``BUSY``
      delivery is the one no-deadline shape that is legitimately LIVE:
      it proves no action turn started, and ``_load`` resumes it at its
      persisted retry deadline, so this pass must too. A claim WITH a
      deadline is safe: its ``next_due_ts`` is that deadline, and the
      armed tick either finds evidence or retires the claim through
      ``record_monitor_completion_evidence_unavailable``.
