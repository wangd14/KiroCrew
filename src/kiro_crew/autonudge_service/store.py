"""``autonudge.json`` and ``autonudge.quarantine.json``: the durable store's state and protocol.

:class:`LoopStore` owns everything about the store that is not a live loop: the two
paths, whether the last load could vet the store at all, the rows held aside in the
sidecar and the rows the loader could not parse, the disk-only cycle-claim markers,
the stop-record baseline of the last committed store, and the removals whose durable
write has not landed yet. It writes a payload atomically (temp file, fsync, sidecar
first, rename as the commit point, stop record under the commit lock, directory sync,
sidecar compaction) and builds every payload's ``loops`` list so no writer can omit a
held or unparsed row.

:class:`~kiro_crew.autonudge.AutoNudgeService` composes one ``LoopStore`` and keeps the
entry points callers and tests patch (``_write_state``, ``_save``, ``_serialize_state``,
``_serialized_loops``). The loader that decides what each stored row MEANS stays on the
service in :mod:`kiro_crew.autonudge`, because it vets and scrubs every row at the trust
boundary; it reads and records through this store.
