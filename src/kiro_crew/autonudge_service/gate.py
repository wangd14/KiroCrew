"""The probe gate: whether one tick of a gated loop is worth a model turn.

:func:`_monitor_tick_is_quiet` observes the subject cheaply and answers True only when
nothing happened; every uncertain path spends the turn. It owns the owed-turn debts
(``floor_fire_pending``, ``poll_in_flight``, ``terminal_pending``), the quiet-streak
floor, the typed terminal settlement that retires a finished watch, and the publication
of each reading before the judge is asked about it.

Its functions are :class:`~kiro_crew.autonudge.AutoNudgeService` methods: each is bound
on the class by name and runs against the service's state through ``self``, and a call
to any other service method goes through ``self`` too, so a patch on the instance

    ``True`` once the baseline is durable and published, ``False`` when the record
    refused it, ``None`` when the loop was re-aimed and there is nothing to commit.

    PERSISTED FIRST, the same way the reading itself is published. The stored
    record is this baseline's authority -- the loader restores it from the
    snapshot -- and the awaited judge write that reached the verdict has already
    landed one holding the OLD baseline. So the new one is written on a staged copy
    and copied over the live loop only once that write has landed. Memory never
    runs ahead of disk: a refused write publishes nothing, so the baseline stays
    exactly what the record holds, and the next tick re-reads these remarks --
    which costs a turn and withholds nothing.

    AWAITED under ``_lock`` for both halves of the same reason. The write has to
    land before the tick's own scheduled write, or a process that stops in between
    leaves disk claiming the old baseline while this tick has already screened
    against the new one, and every remark it passed on reads as new after the
    restart. And the snapshot is taken under the lock so no update can land between
    the copy and the write, which would put a stale row on disk. Holding the lock
    across the write is also what keeps every other writer's snapshot honest: none
    can serialize the loop while its baseline is half-committed.

    ONLY THE BASELINE is published, never the whole staged copy. The lock does not
    cover every writer: ``notify_cycle_landed`` clears the start-failure streak on
    the live loop synchronously and lock-free, from the turn-completion path, and
    can land inside the awaited write. Copying every field of the snapshot back over
    the live loop -- what ``_apply_staged_monitor`` does for a full monitor
    transition -- would silently put that streak back and let the loop back off or
    stand down on a failure a completed turn has just disproved. Writing one field
    cannot revert another.

    A write that lands and is then cancelled still publishes: the snapshot writer
    propagates the cancellation only after the executor result is in, so disk holds
    the new baseline, and a memory left on the old one would hand the next tick a
    record it does not match.

    The re-aim check runs under the lock too. An ``update`` that retargets the
    message or replaces the criteria clears the baseline deliberately, because a
    digest earned under the old question would screen the new one quiet; the caller
    checks the same thing before the await, but an update can land while this call
    waits for the lock.

    Used only where a settlement is about to deactivate a loop, because that is the
    one action here that stops work silently. The answer is deliberately asymmetric:
    only a fresh terminal that CARRIES THE SAME CLASSIFICATION returns True, so an
    unobservable subject -- a failed fetch, a probe defect, a binding that stops
    resolving -- keeps the watch alive rather than letting an absence of evidence
    retire it.

    Matching the classification matters as much as matching the outcome. A pull
    request can be closed, reopened and MERGED inside one channel turn, and a
    revalidation that accepted any terminal would then settle the merge under the
    stale "blocked" marker and announce an unmerged close. When the two disagree the
    owed terminal is simply gone: this returns False, the debt is dropped, and the
    next tick records the real one with the right classification.

    Reuses the tick's fetch machinery, and the same merged-versus-closed rule the
    tick's own terminal branch applies, instead of adding a marker to remember what
    was already delivered. This review has paid for a defect at an existing site for
    each new piece of per-loop state, so re-asking is the cheaper way to answer.
