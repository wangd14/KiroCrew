"""Canonical filenames of the agent configs KiroCrew generates.

Single source of truth for the on-disk names KiroCrew writes into
``~/.kiro/agents/`` (kiro specs). This is a **leaf module** (no intra-package
imports) so both
``agent.py`` (which writes these files) and ``browser/setup.py`` (whose
Playwright convergence sweep must touch only KiroCrew-owned files) can import it
without an import cycle — ``agent.py`` imports ``converge_playwright_servers``
from ``browser/setup.py``, so ``browser/setup.py`` cannot import ``agent.py``.

Keeping the names here — rather than duplicating them as a literal in each
consumer — means adding a new managed agent spec is a one-line change in ONE
place: add its filename to ``OWNED_KIRO_AGENT_FILES`` and every consumer
(including the boot-time self-heal sweep) picks it up.

# every ``session/set_mode`` with "Mode '<name>' not found", so a missing entry
# here fails EVERY turn rather than degrading one feature:
#   * ``kirocrew.json``      — the agent behind user-facing chat.
#   * ``kirocrew-lite.json`` — the cheap background agent (auto-titles,
#     compaction, heartbeat), reached via ``SessionManager.get_bg_session``.
# The remaining OWNED_KIRO_AGENT_FILES entries are deliberately excluded: their
# installers in ``agent.py`` already degrade to ``logger.debug`` on failure
# because each one only disables its own feature (goal conducting, Knowledge
# extraction, Research Lab, unattended heartbeat polling).

# Agent ids the KAS engine (``kiro-cli acp --agent-engine v3``) will not run
# from the wire. A ``_meta.kiro.customAgents`` entry under one of these ids is
# accepted without an error and then either never appears in the session's
# ``availableModes`` or is shadowed by the engine's own built-in agent of that
# id, so a ``session/set_mode`` for it is refused, or activates the built-in
# instead of the definition Crew sent. Measured against kiro-cli 2.23.0 by
# injecting every id below in ONE ``session/new``, each with a distinctive
# ``description``, and reading the advertised mode back:
#
#   injected id                       advertised mode         definition that runs
#   ------------------------------    --------------------    --------------------

#     bug-fix / plan / autonomous     (origin: bundled)       client entry discarded
#   Default / DEFAULT / Vibe / Spec   the client entry        the client entry
#     / PLAN / kiro_default / kiro    (origin: client)
#     / kiro-default / default_agent

#
# The match is therefore exact and case-sensitive: the built-in ids are all
# lower-case, and every case variant registers as an ordinary client agent.
#
# Why this lives with the FILENAMES: Kiro Crew names a crewmate's private
# template copy after the crewmate, and the seeded first crewmate is called
# ``default``, so without this set its first template edit writes
# ``~/.kiro/agents/default.json`` and binds the crewmate to an id that can never
# be activated on KAS. The template writers (fork, publish, create) consult it
# when choosing a stem, and the KAS projection refuses the id with the remedy
# instead of letting the misleading "spec is likely missing" refusal fire, or
# letting a built-in silently run in the crewmate's place.
