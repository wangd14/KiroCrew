#: Attributes an inode-replacing write reproduces on the replacement, and the
#: ONLY ones -- losing any of these leaves the new file protected less than the
#: one it replaced, which is what the carry exists to prevent.
#:
#: This is an ALLOWLIST, and that direction is the security property. Both carry
#: sites install a FRESH inode holding content the CALLER supplied, so every
#: attribute replayed onto it is applied to NEW bytes. Replaying a
#: privilege-bearing attribute therefore grants the new content whatever the old
#: file was trusted with:
#:
#: * ``security.capability`` is file capabilities. An authenticated
#:   ``/api/file-write`` or steering save that rewrites a capability-bearing file
#:   would leave e.g. ``CAP_NET_RAW`` attached to attacker-chosen content -- a
#:   privilege grant the replacement never earned.
#: * ``security.ima`` / ``security.evm`` are integrity signatures OVER THE OLD
#:   BYTES. Carrying them forges an appraisal for content that was never
#:   measured, which is worse than losing one: the file is not merely unprotected
#:   but affirmatively vouched for.
#:
#: A denylist of those three would close exactly today's cases and silently
#: re-open on the next privileged namespace the kernel grows, so the carry names
#: what it needs and drops everything else. Dropping is safe by construction: an
#: attribute the replacement never receives leaves it with the defaults a plain
#: editor save would have produced, which is the floor, not a regression.
#:
#: ``security.selinux`` is deliberately NOT here, on both halves of the argument.
#: A freshly created inode already gets its type from the parent directory's
#: transition rule -- the same label any ordinary save yields -- so carrying buys
#: nothing; and writing that attribute needs ``relabelfrom``/``relabelto`` in the
#: writing domain, which a dashboard process on an enforcing host typically lacks
#: (``EACCES``). Under the fail-closed half of :func:`_carry_xattrs` that would

    *dir_fd* is a descriptor for the destination's ALREADY-PINNED parent — the
    same one the caller hands to ``parent_dir_fd``. With it the leaf is opened as
    a bare component RELATIVE to that descriptor, so the inode whose mode and
    ACL are read is the one inside the directory the caller walked. Opening by
    name after pinning is a hole rather than a redundancy: a directory replaced
    at that name between the pin and this open makes the metadata come from the
    replacement while the write still publishes into the pinned original, so the
    original's file is handed back carrying a mode and ACL chosen by whoever did
    the replacing. Every caller that pins MUST pass it; the pinned parent is only
    worth having if nothing downstream of it is addressed by name again.

    With *dir_fd* the descriptor comes back even where the xattr syscalls are
    absent, and the Windows caveat below does not apply there: pinning needs
    ``O_DIRECTORY``, which Windows does not have, so a pinned caller is on POSIX
    and publishes with ``renameat`` rather than ``os.replace``. That case is not
    hypothetical — macOS has ``openat`` and no ``listxattr`` — and the MODE carry
    needs a descriptor even when the ACL carry has nothing to read, or a by-name
    ``stat`` would reintroduce exactly the mismatch above on that platform.

    Without *dir_fd*, returns ``None`` — meaning "pass no descriptor" — on a
    platform without the xattr syscalls. That is not merely an optimisation:
    there is nothing to carry there, AND holding a read handle open across the
    write is not free on Windows, where ``os.replace`` fails with
    ``PermissionError`` while ANY other handle is open on either path. A
    descriptor kept for a carry that cannot happen would therefore fail every
    write on that platform, which is what this helper exists to prevent — and why
    all three call sites go through it rather than spelling the ``os.open``
    themselves.

    ``O_NOFOLLOW`` carries real weight for one caller and is defense-in-depth for
    the rest. The file-write and steering updates hand in a path already
    canonicalized (``hooks.validate_file_path``) or ``lstat``-checked, so the final
    component is symlink-free by construction there and this open rejects nothing
    legitimate; it closes the window where that component is swapped for a link
    after the check. ``skills._write_skill_md`` has no such check — its guard is a
    plain ``exists()``, which FOLLOWS a link — so for that caller this open is what
    refuses a symlinked ``SKILL.md`` in the first place. An ``OSError`` propagates
    so the caller can treat it as a rejected target rather than a server fault, and
    all three do.

    Atomic replacement is the last step of every tmp-file-plus-rename writer. On

    written temp file is enough, so a correct atomic write can still lose its

    The retry sleeps, so it is gated on there being no running event loop in
    this thread. A caller reached from the gateway loop gets the plain
    ``os.replace`` semantics it had before this retry existed: the

    loop of its own, so the retry applies there.

    The final attempt sits OUTSIDE the retry loop on purpose. With it inside,
    a budget of 0 would skip the body entirely and return having renamed

    the rename retry deliberately. Both bound the same transient — one Windows
    sharing-violation window — so a second knob would only let the two halves of
    one behaviour drift apart.

    On POSIX a ``PermissionError`` is a genuine access fault and is re-raised
    immediately rather than slept over, and the retry is gated on there being no
    running event loop in this thread: a caller reached from the gateway loop
    gets the plain single-attempt semantics instead of pausing the one loop for
    the whole budget. Callers wanting the retry from a loop-driven path offload
    the read (``asyncio.to_thread`` / ``run_in_executor``), which is what
    ``CrewStore``'s builder already does.

    The final attempt sits OUTSIDE the loop for the same reason it does in
    :func:`replace_with_retry`: with it inside, a budget of 0 would fall out
    having read nothing and return ``None`` to a caller expecting bytes.

    ``max_bytes`` bounds the allocation, not the file: at most that many bytes
    are read and returned, so a caller enforcing a size cap passes ``cap + 1``
    and refuses the document when the result is longer than ``cap`` -- without
    first allocating whatever an oversized file at the path happens to hold.
    ``None`` (the default) reads the whole file.

    guards in the tree. Those fold three distinct outcomes into one silent
    fallback, so a genuinely absent file and a momentary read failure look
    identical in ``kirocrew logs``. This helper keeps the tolerance and adds one
    signal for the case that was mute:

    * **Absent** (``FileNotFoundError``) -- return ``default`` silently. The
      ordinary "no file yet" case; nothing has degraded.
    * **Malformed / undecodable** (``json.JSONDecodeError``, a decode error, or
      any other ``ValueError``) -- return ``default`` silently. Preserves the
      deliberate decode-tolerance the callers already have: a damaged or
      wrong-encoding file must not crash the reader, and sleeping cannot mend it.
    * **A non-absent ``OSError`` / ``PermissionError``** -- emit exactly one
      ``logger.warning`` and return ``default``. On Windows a read of a whole,
      correct file raises ``PermissionError`` (``WinError 32``) while another
      handle holds it open for a tmp-file-plus-``os.replace`` write, the read
      twin of the window :func:`replace_with_retry` survives. POSIX permits the
      read, so this leg fires only on a real fault there. This is the outcome the
      hand-written guards were silent about.

    The bytes are read through :func:`read_bytes_with_retry`, so the Windows
    sharing-violation window is retried first (off the event loop) and only a
    degrade that OUTLASTS the retry budget reaches the warning -- retry and
    signal compose, they do not duplicate.

    The warning carries only an exception-class name, a fixed outcome word, and
    the caller's optional *what* label. It NEVER carries the path, the file
    bytes, a slug, a URL, a secret, or any subject key -- a log line about a
    degraded read must not become a channel for the content that failed to read.

    *logger* is the caller's own module logger, so the line is attributed to the
    site that degraded. *what* is a short, non-sensitive noun for the document
    ("dev_fleet config", "issue signals") when the module logger name alone is
    not enough to place it. *rate_limit* (on by default) bounds the warning to

    ``os.replace`` does not follow the final component, so it replaces the link
    itself with the new file (verified — the link's target keeps its old
    contents), which is the same outcome as writing over a regular file.

    lstat-based, so it is not race-free: a link planted between this check and
    the ``mkstemp`` below still wins. Closing that would need an ``O_NOFOLLOW``
    descent with a directory handle per component, which ``tempfile`` cannot be
    driven through. ``memory.py``'s lock-path check states the same limitation

    e.g. a document that is read back, edited and saved again, where
    translation on every save would accumulate carriage returns. It is
    meaningless for ``bytes`` content, which is never translated, so passing
    both raises rather than silently ignoring the argument.

    *restrict_to_owner* locks the file down to its owner for secret-bearing
    payloads (credentials, HMAC keys, tokens). It is NOT the same as
    ``mode=0o600``: ``fchmod_safe`` is a documented no-op on Windows, so
    ``mode`` alone leaves a Windows temp readable at its inherited DACL for the
    whole write. This applies
    :func:`platform_compat.restrict_to_owner` to the temp file BEFORE any
    content reaches it — the ordering the hand-rolled sites already use — so
    the secret never exists in a world-readable file. It also implies
    ``0o600`` on POSIX, hence the conflict check below: passing a wider
    explicit *mode* alongside it is a caller bug, and narrowing it silently
    would hide that. It further implies :func:`_refuse_linked_parent`: a secret
    writer must never follow a link, because a pre-planted parent symlink or
    junction redirects the whole write to a location the caller never named.

    *restrict_on_error* selects what happens when that lockdown fails, and only
    means anything alongside ``restrict_to_owner=True``. The default ``"raise"``
    refuses to write a secret it cannot protect. ``"warn"`` logs and writes
    anyway, for the callers whose own comments say the write matters more than
    the permissions: ``sel.py`` must not brick SecurityEventLog init on a
    read-only filesystem, and ``dashboard/refresh_tokens.py`` must not drop
    refresh-token reuse-detection state. Note the asymmetry the two platforms
    give ``"warn"``: on POSIX ``restrict_to_owner`` is ``chmod(0o600)``, which
    the ``fchmod_safe`` below repeats, so the file still lands at ``0o600``
    after a warn; on Windows ``fchmod_safe`` is a no-op, so a warn genuinely
    publishes the file under its inherited ACL. That is the exposure those
    callers accept today, stated rather than implied.

    *preserve_access_control_from* is an OPEN file descriptor for the file being
    replaced. When given, the source's extended attributes are read from that
    descriptor BEFORE staging and reproduced on the replacement inode before the
    rename. ``mode=`` alone carries permission BITS only, so a named POSIX ACL
    (stored in ``system.posix_acl_access``/``_default``) the owner set is
    otherwise dropped the moment a fresh inode is installed, handing back
    a file protected more narrowly than the one it replaced. What is carried is an
    ALLOWLIST -- those two names plus informational ``user.*`` -- and privileged
    namespaces are deliberately excluded, because the replacement holds content
    the CALLER supplied: see :data:`_CARRIED_ACCESS_CONTROL_XATTRS`. The rest of
    the policy mirrors
    ``hooks.safe_write_file_nolink``: an access-control attribute that cannot be
    carried REFUSES the write (the original is left untouched); an informational
    ``user.*`` attribute is best effort; a filesystem with no xattrs at all
    (``ENOTSUP``/``EOPNOTSUPP``/``ENOSYS``) is nothing to carry, not an error; any
    OTHER read failure is a refusal, because a failed lookup is not proof that
    there are none. Reading from the descriptor rather than by name keeps the
    read pinned to the inode the caller validated. The carry is ADDITIVE to
    ``mode=``, not a replacement.

    *parent_dir_fd* is an OPEN descriptor for the destination's directory,
    already pinned component-by-component by the caller (``pinned_fs`` supplies
    the walk). When given on a platform that can stage and rename through a
    descriptor (:func:`pinned_parent_replace_supported`), the temp file is
    created with ``os.open(name, O_CREAT|O_EXCL|O_NOFOLLOW, dir_fd=)`` and the
    publishing rename is ``renameat`` -- both ends relative to that descriptor --
    so neither the temp creation nor the rename re-resolves the parent by name and
    an ancestor swapped after the caller's validation cannot redirect the write.
    ``None`` (default) keeps the by-name ``mkstemp`` + rename floor exactly as
    before, and that is what a platform lacking the descriptor-relative syscalls
    must pass: it is the same platform that cannot pin a directory at all, so the
    floor adds no exposure the declared by-name traversal does not already carry.
    A descriptor handed in where :func:`pinned_parent_replace_supported` is False is
    REFUSED rather than ignored — a caller that walked a parent and passed the
    result believes the write is pinned, so quietly staging and renaming by name
    instead would leave that belief wrong and nothing would say so. Callers ask
    both probes (``pinned_fs.supports_pinned_walk()`` for the walk that produces
    the descriptor, this module's for the write that consumes it) and pass ``None``
    when either is False, which is why the refusal is unreachable in normal
    operation and fires only on probe drift. The destination's own name still comes
    from *path*; only the directory it is resolved through is pinned. It is also
    REFUSED alongside *restrict_to_owner*, whose lockdown is applied to the staged
    file by name and so cannot address a descriptor-relative temp.
