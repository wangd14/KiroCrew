"""What reaches the prompt: the skills directory, required bodies and trigger delivery.

``get_context`` renders the bounded startup directory, or the explicit unbudgeted
legacy reader. On the budgeted path every ``always: true`` body is charged against
``PINNED_SKILL_BODIES_CAP``, and one that cannot fit or load raises rather than
being trimmed.
``split_triggered`` and ``trigger_hint`` decide how a trigger match is
delivered: a body by default, a one-line pointer for an unconfined skill that
opted out. Matching itself (``SkillsLoader.get_triggered_skills``) stays in the
