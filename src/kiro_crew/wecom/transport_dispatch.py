"""Full new-path dispatch: WeComTransport -> TurnDriver -> WeComRenderer.

``WeComTransport.receive()`` authorizes + normalizes an inbound WS frame and
hands the ``WeComInbound`` (carrying the WS routing keys ``req_id`` /
``response_url``) to :meth:`WeComDispatcher.handle_message`, which mirrors the
Slack/Telegram transport dispatch:

    command intercept (/new, /compact)
    -> construct WeComRenderer + on_turn_start (immediate "🤔 …" placeholder)
    -> session acquire -> context build
    -> TurnDriver.run(provider, renderer)   # shared redaction + approval ladder
    -> post-turn (record_success, persist, soft/hard threshold notice)  # guarded
    -> renderer.close() + session release   # in finally

WeCom has no interactive buttons and no callback handler, so the dispatcher
runs the driver ``decider``-less. That alone would leave the INTERACTIVE ladder
denying every tool, so ``ChannelTurn.auto_approve_session`` carries the
process-global safety-override grant (``auto``/``trust`` modes still
auto-approve on their own). The security ``tool_gate`` and the ``spawn_run``
auto-approve are wired by the shared pipeline off ``ctx_builder.hooks``
(channel-neutral) so this module never imports ``kiro_crew.slack``.

Dependency direction is ``wecom -> messaging`` (allowed).
