"""The dashboard-control MCP server — the agent's hands on the dashboard's own
organization surfaces.

Deliberately NOT part of ``kirocrew-core``. Core is the tool surface EVERY
session carries, and kiro-cli reads ``tools/list`` once per session, so anything
listed there spends context in every request of every session forever — whether
or not the user ever wants it. Reorganizing the sidebar is something a user asks
for on purpose, occasionally; it does not belong in the always-on surface.

So this is its own server, and it is an ASSIGNABLE SET: an agent gets these
tools when its own kiro spec carries both the ``mcpServers`` entry and the
matching ``@kirocrew-dashboard`` reference in ``tools`` — kiro-cli loads a server
only when something references it. The default agent's spec carries neither, so
a session on the default agent pays nothing for a capability it never uses, and
an agent that should reorganize the dashboard is granted it deliberately.

Assignment is per SERVER, not per tool: a spec that references this server gets
every tool in it. That is the unit to keep in mind when adding one — a capability
that must be grantable separately belongs in a server of its own.

What it controls today is the chat (sidebar) folder tree: read it, create a
folder, reparent a folder, and file a live session into one. Create and move
only — no delete and no rename, so nothing here can lose a conversation. It also
controls session TAGS with the same posture: read the vocabulary, create or
update a tag (rename, recolor, status flag), and add or remove tags on a live
session — no tag delete, so nothing here can strip a label from every session
at once, and the assignment is a DELTA the endpoint applies compare-and-set
against the revision this server read, so an agent never clobbers a tag the
person clicked on meanwhile. It can pin or unpin a live session with the same
ownership rules as tagging one. Every tool is a thin proxy over the dashboard's
existing endpoints (loopback +
``X-Internal-Secret``); the endpoints keep owning every tree invariant, and the
gateway audits each write with the caller's declared component name — this
server's requests carry ``X-Internal-Caller: kirocrew-dashboard`` (attached
centrally by ``run_mcp_stdio_loop`` + the ``mcp_core`` request helpers), which
``chat_folders._audit_origin`` validates against its known-caller set — so the
log can tell an agent's move from the user's own, and from any future internal
caller's.

Why the set needs no second gate behind the assignment: these tools grant no
read the agent does not already have (``list_sessions`` in ``kirocrew-core`` is
always available and already returns every session's title and key), they cannot
delete a folder or a conversation, and the worst outcome is a sidebar the user
has to tidy. Contrast the keystone leaves in ``security.py``
(``computer_use.json``, ``browser-mode-enabled``, the Ops Mission Control mode):
each grants reach OUTSIDE Kiro Crew — desktop input synthesis, the operator's
logged-in browser, writes against production incident tooling — or is the
security floor itself, and each is therefore stored where the agent cannot write.

The rule that follows, and the reason the tool set is ratcheted in
``test_mcp_dashboard_registration.py``: a capability whose blast radius DOES
require authorization needs its own keystone leaf, and being merely unreferenced
in the default spec is not that. Session control (driving or stopping another
session) is that shape.

Identity posture: two resolvers, for two different jobs. The SEL invocation log
(``_call_tool``) uses the NON-strict resolver — that header is ATTRIBUTION, and
a lenient misattribution there is tolerable. Every decision that SCOPES what a
caller may see or verify-writes — ``_visible_chat_slots``,
``_refuse_tree_shaping_if_unverifiable``, and ``chat_folder_move_session``'s own
caller check (the one tool here that writes to a session other than the
caller's) — uses :func:`mcp_core._resolve_session_key_strict`, whose first
source is the gateway-injected per-call caller block — the only identity that
holds on a pooled backend serving many sessions (this server advertises
``kirocrew.caller-identity`` so gatewayd injects one; see
``ADVERTISE_CALLER_IDENTITY``). An unverifiable caller is refused by those
paths, never waved through on the lenient walk.

    key at all. The sidebar tolerates all three; so must every reader here.

    Only a real JSON number is accepted, and the frontend's counterpart accepts
    exactly the same set. That is deliberate: this value has to sort IDENTICALLY

    ``chat_folder_tree`` is where an agent picks a ``before``/``after`` anchor, so a
    sequence that differs from the rendered one aims the anchor at the wrong gap.
    That makes this key part of a contract with ``folderTree.bySidebarOrder``, and
    every operation in it has to mean the same thing in both languages.

    No Unicode-table fold. ``str.lower()`` reads the interpreter's tables and
    ``String.prototype.toLowerCase()`` reads the browser's, so a character whose case
    mapping was added or changed between the interpreter's version and the browser's
    folds differently on the two sides — a skew no code here can close, because
    neither side owns both tables.

    ``A``-``Z`` fold anyway, through the literal 26-entry table above. That range's
    case mapping is fixed for every Unicode version ever published and the frontend
    does the same fold by ARITHMETIC on the code unit, so it carries no version
    dependency while still ordering ``alpha`` before ``Beta``. The distinction is
    worth drawing because a store written before ``order`` existed has every sibling
    tied at 0 — the whole tie-break decides those sidebars, so a fold that only
    ordered by raw code unit would show them uppercase-first until the first drag.

    ``utf-16-be`` rather than the str itself: Python orders str by CODE POINT while
    JavaScript orders by UTF-16 CODE UNIT, and the two disagree above U+FFFF — an
    astral character's surrogates start at 0xD800, so Python sorts U+1F600 after
    U+FF21 and JavaScript sorts it before. Comparing the big-endian UTF-16 bytes is
    code-unit order. This is a fixed encoding, not a table lookup, so it carries no
    version dependency either.

    ``surrogatepass`` because a folder name is persisted JSON and can hold a LONE
    surrogate, which the strict codec refuses outright — and a raised encoder
    inside a sort key takes down every folder tool, not one row. Passing it through
    also keeps the byte-for-byte match: a JavaScript string holds that same lone
    unit and compares it as 0xD800, which is exactly what these bytes carry.

    A name that is not a ``str`` reads as empty rather than being stringified, and
    the frontend's counterpart does the same. Stringifying is where the two
    languages part company: ``str({"a": 1})`` is ``"{'a': 1}"`` where
    ``String({a: 1})`` is ``"[object Object]"``, and ``str(True)`` is ``"True"``
    where ``String(true)`` is ``"true"``. Reading the whole class as empty makes

      creating a folder literally named after the hex id is never what a caller

    * **A full human path.** A folder NAME may itself contain ``/`` (the
      sidebar permits it), so ``A/B`` can be one folder named ``A/B`` as well as
      ``B`` inside ``A``, and the tree renders both identically. Both readings
      are computed; when they disagree, or when either is itself duplicated, the
      reference is refused rather than resolved to whichever came first.
    * **A path to walk**, segment by segment, creating what is missing when

    Pure apart from the creation leg: the caller already holds the folder list,

    Only a ``dashboard:<slot>`` key qualifies, and it must name a row that is

    Folders now carry an owner (``chat_folders._folder_owner_app``), so an app
    HAS a folder of its own to write to and the endpoint bounds each write to
    it: an app may create at the top level or inside its own folders, and may
    rename, reparent or delete only what it owns. The person keeps full
    authority over everything, and an app keeps read of the whole tree plus
    filing its OWN sessions into any folder.

    So this layer does not decide the policy — that would be a second copy of a
    rule the endpoint enforces under the store lock, and only the endpoint can
    see the authoritative tree. What stays here is the one question the endpoint
    cannot answer: whether the caller can be placed at all. An unverifiable or
    delegated caller has no scope to bound a write to, and a write to shared
    structure is not the place to assume the caller is the human.

    The verified key is RETURNED rather than left for the write helpers to
    re-derive. Those default to :func:`_resolve_session_key`, whose ``/proc``
    ancestor walk can resolve to a different slot than the strict check above —
    so re-resolving would check one identity and write under another, and for an
    app-owned session the walk landing on an ancestor makes the write arrive at
    the endpoint looking like the unconfined person. Every caller of this gate
    must pass what it returns straight to the write.

    ``caller_app`` (``""`` for the person) comes back for the same reason: it is
    the identity the endpoint will judge each write against, and a caller that
    must issue SEVERAL writes to keep one call atomic can only check them all up
    front by holding it. Re-deriving it would mean a second ``/api/chat/slots``
    fetch, against a roster that may have changed.

#: Whether this server advertises ``kirocrew.caller-identity`` — i.e. whether it
#: consumes the per-call caller block gatewayd injects instead of reading identity
#: from its own process. True here because it does: every scoping decision
#: (``_visible_chat_slots``, ``_refuse_tree_shaping_if_unverifiable``) resolves
#: the caller through :func:`mcp_core._resolve_session_key_strict`, whose first
#: source is that block.
#:
#: Advertising is not cosmetic. ``mcp_gateway/backend.py`` strips any client-forged
#: caller block from EVERY forwarded request and re-injects its own only when the
#: backend advertised this capability — so without the advertisement the block
#: never arrives, and this server's resolver reads an empty identity no matter how
#: correctly it is written. Nothing declines to POOL an unadvertised backend
#: (``rewriter.UNPOOLABLE_SERVERS`` is empty and documents that the capability is
#: read only to decide injection), so the unadvertised state was not "per-session
#: spawn" — it was pooled AND identity-blind. For this server that fail-closed
#: every scoped tool on a pooled backend: an unverifiable caller is refused, so
#: the tools stopped working for exactly the sessions pooling was built to serve.
#:
#: A module-level constant rather than a bare argument below so the value is
#: readable without executing :func:`run_mcp_server`, and so
#: ``test/test_mcp_managed_caller_identity.py`` can assert it against the argument
#: actually handed to the shim.
