"""Session-directive protocol — stateless session-bound MCP tools.

Some KiroCrew MCP tools act on *the session that called them* — arm a monitor
loop, set a chat slot's project, render a follow-up card. In the unpooled
(gateway-off) topology the MCP server cannot know which session is calling
(one ``kirocrew-core`` serves the whole runtime, and the ``/proc`` walk is
refused because a session-sharing subagent would misattribute to its parent).

Rather than invent a per-process identity source, these tools stay STATELESS:
the tool VALIDATES its arguments and returns a *directive* — a human-readable
confirmation line plus a machine-readable marker carrying the validated payload
(and NO session key). A session-aware consumer that processes the tool result
decodes the marker and applies the effect against ITS OWN session, then keeps
the marker out of what it stores or renders. There are TWO consumers, one per
turn loop: :func:`dashboard.chat_runner._run_chat`'s ``EVENT_TOOL_RESULT``
handler (the dashboard-driven surfaces, which own ``slot.key``), and
:class:`messaging.driver.TurnDriver` (the standalone channel transports —
Telegram, Discord, standalone Slack, iMessage, Teams, Webex, WeCom, Weixin —
whose dispatchers inject a consumer bound to the turn's session key via
``messaging.dispatch.build_directive_consumer``). Both funnel into
``dashboard.session_directive_apply.apply_session_directive``, so the security
boundaries live in one place.

Subagent isolation is therefore STRUCTURAL, not cryptographic: a subagent's
tool result flows through the subagent's own runner, so it can only ever bind to
the subagent's session — never its parent's. There is no walk to get wrong.

FORGERY: the marker payload is model-visible (it comes back as the tool result
text), so a model *could* emit the literal bytes. The consumer defends by
honouring a directive ONLY when the tool call it arrived under was recorded — by
KiroCrew observing the tool CALL — as an MCP-served call whose CANONICAL name
(``_meta.kiro.toolName``, with ``_meta.kiro.mcpServerName`` set) is one of
:data:`DIRECTIVE_TOOLS`. That identity comes from kiro-cli's out-of-band ``_meta``
channel, NOT the ``title`` (which is LLM-authored prose for shell tools — a shell
command titled ``"monitor_start"`` whose stdout forges the marker must NOT be
honoured). The gate fails closed when ``_meta`` identity is absent. The payload
never carries a session key (the session is supplied by the consumer), and the
consumer additionally refuses native-sub-agent tool calls, which surface as flat
events in the parent loop but have no independently bindable slot. A model
echoing the marker from any non-directive (or non-MCP) tool resolves to no
directive tool and is ignored.

    """Digest of a tool CALL's raw arguments -- the out-of-band SELECTOR.

    A directive tool's validated payload is parked on the gateway
    (``dashboard.directive_queue``) and the turn's consumer claims it. The
    consumer cannot learn WHICH record to claim from the tool RESULT text, because
    that text is whatever the backend chose to put on
    the wire: KAS re-serialises the envelope (quotes escaped), copies the result
    into two fields, replaces one of them with an offload reference above a size
    threshold, and caps every string at 30k chars with the tail-anchored marker
    falling off the end. Each shape is one more repair branch in the shared ACP
    parser, and each backend can add another at any time.

    The tool call's INPUT reaches both sides through no envelope at all. The MCP
    server receives it as the ``arguments`` of ``tools/call``; the consumer sees
    it as the ``rawInput`` of the ACP ``tool_call`` frame, which kiro-agent emits
    uncapped. So the tool digests what it was called with and parks that beside
    the payload, the consumer digests what it saw the model call with, and the
    two agree without either reading the result body.

    Same trust shape as the marker it replaces: model-controlled content, bound
    to the session because it arrives on that session's own event stream in the
    very call the tool served. A caller who can park a record for another
    session still needs THAT session's model to make a call with identical
    arguments in the same turn -- the bar the marker set. The applied payload is
    always the record's; the digest only picks which record.

    ``tool`` is the directive tool's own bare name (a :data:`DIRECTIVE_TOOLS`
    member). The MCP server knows it as the ``tools/call`` name; the consumer
    resolves it with :func:`directive_tool_from_call` from the frame's trusted
    ``_meta.kiro`` identity or, on a backend without one, from the wire title
    kiro-agent's MCP wrapper stamps as ``@<server>/<tool>``.

    ``_meta`` is dropped before hashing: kiro-agent's MCP wrapper strips it before
    ``callTool`` (it is a per-call transport block, not an argument), so the tool
    never sees it while the consumer's ``rawInput`` does. Keys are sorted and
    ``default=str`` mirrors :func:`encode`, so a value only one side could
    serialise still compares equal. Non-dict input digests as its ``str``: the
    schema-less deferred path can hand a string where a dict was meant, and both
    sides see the same string.

    would otherwise resolve here and record a digest it has no business holding.

    only chosen which record to look up, and the record was still parked by a real
