"""Workflow-mode execution: a campaign run as a Dynamic Workflow.

Owns starting the research template on the gateway's ``WorkflowService``,
cancelling it, and the watchdog adapter that translates a run's events and
result into the same cycle files, ``FINDINGS.md``, bookkeeping and SSE the
dashboard already consumes. ``workflow_run.json`` records the run id and the
cycle offset, so a run resumed after a pause appends findings rather than
re-indexing over the previous run's.
