"""PPTX Maker — path resolution and containment.

The single sanitizer layer for this app. Every filesystem path that is derived
from a browser request goes through one of the ``resolve_*`` helpers here, each
of which returns either a path that is provably contained inside an allowed root
or ``None``. Callers MUST use the returned value and never the caller's original
string, so no untrusted path reaches a filesystem operation.

Three roots matter:

* ``DECK_ROOT`` — where the presentation engine writes decks. Resolved from
  (in order) ``KIROCREW_PPTX_DECK_ROOT`` (dev/test override), the engine's own
  ``config.json``, then the engine default. Deck artifacts are SERVED to the
  browser, so this is the root with the strictest containment.
* ``engine_root()`` — the vendored engine checkout under the app's data dir.
* ``user_config_dir()`` — the engine's user config dir (styles, templates,
  ``state.json``), which the library endpoints write to.

Containment is enforced twice on purpose: every path SEGMENT must match a
conservative allow-list (so ``..`` and separators can never appear), and the
resolved result must still be inside the root after symlinks are followed.
