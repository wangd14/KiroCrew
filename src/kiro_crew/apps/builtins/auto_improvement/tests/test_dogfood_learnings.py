"""Fixes derived from analyzing the app's own dogfood run (31 findings, 1 landed).

The funnel showed the loop's problem was DELIVERY and COVERAGE, not judgement:

* 6 candidates passed the complete gate (RED x2 -> GREEN -> STAYGREEN), but only 1
  reached the branch. Three died at the final ``git push`` with ``non-fast-forward``
  because the branch legitimately advanced during the ~1h run.
* 17 of 31 findings (55%) were never attempted at all — the CYCLE cap bound long before
  the time budget (the run stopped with 0.72h of 1.5h unused).
* The keeper's noise-band test was hardcoded to ``minimize``, so the perf track would
  score a ``maximize`` metric with an inverted comparison. The loop found this itself;
  its fix added a ``direction`` parameter, but nothing PASSED one — so it was inert
  until the driver was wired to the ruler.

    Verified against this repo's own architecture rather than assumed:

    `EVENT_TOOL_CALL` branch is documented informational-only — "the tool is already
    running (auto-approved by kiro-cli), so hook results cannot block execution"
    (`hooks.py`). `governance.md` states the consequence directly: an agent that writes
    itself into `allowedTools` makes kiro-cli stop sending permission requests and
    "Plane A never runs at all" for that tool.

    So pre-authorizing `execute_bash`/`fs_read` made the governance gate — the enterprise
    ceiling, the builtin denied rules, and the `~/.aws`/`~/.ssh` sensitive-path blocks —
    inert for exactly the tools a repository prompt injection would want. `tools` is
    retained (the agent can still REQUEST them, and each request is then governed and
    audited); only the blanket pre-approval goes. This matches the sibling
    `pr-author.json`, which ships no `allowedTools`, and the computer-use precedent of
    granting `tools` but deliberately not `allowedTools`.

    GenAI tool-use security guidance is explicit that capabilities must be least-privilege

    enough). Every clone the loop works in is therefore in that state, which made
    `git fetch --quiet origin <branch>` exit 128 and `commit_finding` return
    "could not fetch" before it applied anything. Measured against a local bare repo:
    fetch by remote name succeeded before the neutralization and failed with

    Every pre-existing test for this function exercised a REFUSAL path (no queued diff,

    puts the whole profile + spine tree into every boot — including CLI invocations that

    The rule is also satisfiable without the regression: the repo's own precedent
    (``docs/system-specs/modules/computer-use.md`` on ``macos_ffi.py``) is that
    ``top-level-imports`` governs where the import STATEMENT sits, and deferring work that

    the candidate commit. Measured on a real bare repo: after drafting finding-1 and then
    finding-2, finding-2's pushed branch contained BOTH commits and its diff touched
    finding-1's file as well as its own.

    A second manual draft happens to rescue itself, because `materialize_queued_diff` does
    `checkout -B <branch> <freshly-fetched-base>`. The path that does NOT recover is a later
    RUN: `clone_setup.checkout_branch` early-returns "already on <branch>" when HEAD is
    already there, without resetting, so the run adopts the leftover commit as its baseline
    and every subsequent measurement is taken against a tree that silently contains a filed
    fix. That is D-70's defect in the operator-triggered route, and unlike D-71's perf case
    there is no cumulative-measurement argument for keeping it: a manual draft is one
    discrete "publish this queued finding" action, not an evolutionary loop.

    denylist inspects only the REQUESTED command: `gh pr comment` is refused, but
    `python helper.py` is allowed and the helper could call `gh api` itself. The premise is
    correct — measured, `python helper.py`, `make test` and `./run.sh` are all ALLOWED.

    The proposed fix is declined, because it deletes the feature: the watcher's own prompt
    requires running the repo's build/test/lint commands, `gh pr view --comments`,
    `gh pr checks`, `gh run view --log-failed`, a rebase, and a local commit. Without Bash
    there is no watcher.

    The mutation is instead blocked one layer down, where it is actually enforceable rather
    than pattern-matched: a nested process inherits no GitHub credential.
      * ``strip_credential_env`` removes GH_TOKEN / GITHUB_TOKEN / GITHUB_ENTERPRISE_TOKEN
        from the spawn env, so the env route is closed.
      * ``sandboxed_spawn_argv(mode="strict")`` hides ``~/.config/gh``, so the STORED OAuth
        credential is closed too — which is the route a token-strip alone would miss.

    Measured on the author's host: `~/.config/gh` contains `hosts.yml`, yet a nested
    `subprocess` inside the sandbox lists that directory as EMPTY, and a nested
    `gh auth status` reports "You are not logged into any GitHub hosts" (rc=1). So the
    escalation this finding describes ends at an unauthenticated `gh`. The denylist remains
    valuable as defence in depth for the DIRECT command; it was never the only control.

    Review proposed `"python"`. That is better but still not right, for a reason this repo has
    already written down twice:
      * `mcp_gateway/rewriter.py` bakes `sys.executable` into its stub entry precisely because

      * `platform_compat._is_windows_store_python_stub` exists because on Windows
        `shutil.which("python")` can resolve a 0-BYTE Microsoft-Store reparse point — so bare
        `python` is itself a known-broken candidate.

    So the manifest keeps a readable default and registration RESOLVES it to the running

class TestWatcherSandboxConfinesCredentialsButNotEgress:
    """The watcher's residual risk, pinned and stated rather than papered over.

    Review asked twice to remove `Bash` from the PR watcher (D-84, then again). It stays,
    because the watcher's four documented jobs — run the repo's build/test/lint, rebase,
    `gh pr view --comments`, commit locally — are all shell, so removing it deletes the
    feature rather than hardening it. But the second report added a claim D-84 never tested,
    and re-measuring showed it is CORRECT:

      * CREDENTIALS are confined. A nested process under `mode="strict"` sees `~/.aws`,
        `~/.config/gh` and `~/.docker` as EMPTY on a host where they are populated, and
        `~/.ssh` exposes only `known_hosts` (deliberate — host-key verification needs it)
        while `id_rsa`/`*.key` stay hidden. `gh auth status` reports "not logged into any
        GitHub hosts".
      * NETWORK EGRESS is NOT confined. The sandbox never enters a network namespace
        (`CLONE_NEWNET` appears nowhere in `sandbox.py`, and its own docstring explains that
        agentic commands need reachable networking). `curl`/`wget`/`nc` are on
        `_FORBIDDEN_BINARIES`, but `python helper.py` is ALLOWED and can open a socket, so a
        prompt-injection in a PR comment can reach the network. The denylist cannot close
        this — it gates the requested command, not what that command then does.

    So the honest posture is: the watcher may be pointed only at repositories whose PR
    comments you would be willing to execute. That is documented at the disclosure sink and
    in the module spec; these tests pin the half that IS enforced, so a regression in the
    credential confinement fails loudly instead of quietly widening the gap.
