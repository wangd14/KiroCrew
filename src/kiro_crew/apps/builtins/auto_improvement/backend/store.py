"""On-disk layout for the app's artifacts and chat-session records.

The upstream app wrote everything under its own host's data directory
via its own path module. Here the root comes from Kiro Crew's app manager
(``app_data_dir``), so it lands under ``$KIROCREW_HOME/apps/auto-improvement/data``
and honours a relocated data home.

Artifact layout is preserved from the original (the ruler/results/ledger shapes
are what the spine writes and the UI reads), with two renames carrying the
CR→PR vocabulary change:

    pr_queue/<fp>.diff, <fp>.pr.md     was cr_queue/<fp>.cr.md
    sessions/<key>.json                NEW — chat-session records (requirement 3)

``scratch`` deliberately lives OUTSIDE ``data/``: it holds the push-disabled
target clone and per-candidate worktrees, which are large, disposable, and must
never be confused with the durable record.
