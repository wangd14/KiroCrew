"""Results archive — the candidate population store (spine durable state).

One of the two durable stores (the other is the git working branch). The archive
carries the WHOLE candidate population including near-misses, run metadata,
anchors and drift, while git carries only kept commits. This separation is what
lets "revert" be "don't apply the diff to the branch" while a discarded diff
still survives as evolutionary memory for the next cycle's proposer (top-K).

Layout (02_architecture.md §3.3 — spine schema; the metric columns of
``results.tsv`` are profile-provided):

    results/
      run.meta.json        # base sha, anchors, noise band, profile id, host pinning
      results.tsv          # one row per MEASURED candidate (append-only, greppable)
      candidates.jsonl     # one rich JSON object per measured candidate
      candidates/<id>.diff # unified diff vs cycle base, for EVERY survivor
      candidates/<id>.json # per-candidate detail (stages, all A/B reps)
      anchors/             # frozen anchors + provenance
      drift/               # periodic re-measure of current best (§4.3)

Docs: 02_architecture.md §3, §4.2 (resume reads this), 10_roadmap M0
("durable state = git branch + results/ archive").

# The spine fixes these control columns; the ruler contributes the primary-metric,

# Measurement.secondary dict (the NON-BLOCKING resource/throughput metrics the ruler
# sampled — the extra results.tsv columns beyond the primary; METRICS.md §6). It is the
# last column so the fixed positional control columns keep their offsets and the greppable
# TSV stays append-compatible while carrying the profile's secondary metric names; the
# full per-metric dict is also stored in the JSONL row (and the per-candidate JSON).
