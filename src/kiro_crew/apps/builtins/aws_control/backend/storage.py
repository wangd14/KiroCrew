"""Drive storage engine — one private bucket per account, three prefixes.

The bucket is the substrate for three console sections, each a view over one
key prefix: ``artifacts/`` (Library), ``drive/`` (Drive), ``backup/``
(Backup). One engine, one discipline, three views.

Everything routes through :func:`kiro_crew.deploy.engine.run_aws` — the AWS
CLI subprocess chokepoint (``--profile``, fixed argv, OS sandbox). No boto3,
no credential material, gateway-side only. The deploy engine's discipline is
inherited deliberately:

* **Stateless-by-tag discovery.** The bucket carries an opaque generated name
  (``kirocrew-drive-<12hex>``) and is found by tags, requiring BOTH
  ``kirocrew:managed=true`` AND ``kirocrew:drive=default``, plus the naming
  scheme — and multiple matches fail loud rather than last-match-wins,
  because discovery is a trust decision (delete/overwrite operate on what it
  returns).
* **Hardened at creation** via the deploy engine's own ``_harden_bucket``
  (BPA on, AES256 SSE, BucketOwnerEnforced), THEN versioning is enabled — the
  drive's deliberate delta from deploy-web. deploy-web keeps versioning off
  because its teardown empties with ``s3 rm`` (current versions only); the
  drive has no teardown surface in this PR, and artifact versions ↔ object
  versions is the point of the Library. Versioning also means a plain delete
  reclaims nothing: :func:`delete_key` and :func:`delete_prefix` write delete
  MARKERS and the bytes stay behind them as noncurrent versions, still billed.
  :func:`list_object_versions` and :func:`delete_object_versions` are the pair
  that erases bytes, and the backup retention sweep is their one caller; a
  future whole-drive destroy needs them too.

CALLER CONTRACT (load-bearing): these functions do NOT check consent. Every
HTTP handler must gate with ``aws_consent.refuse_and_log(SERVICE_S3, ...)``
before calling in, and every mutating handler must run the two-call confirm
gate. The functions are sync (subprocess-bound) — call via
``asyncio.to_thread``.

    This is a question about SYNTAX, not about identity. Whether a syntactically
    valid id names bytes this install can claim is a different question, decided by
    the caller against its own upload record -- ``backup._is_provable_version_id``
    is the one that rejects ``"null"``, which is well-formed here and names a
    version SLOT rather than one version. Two checks because they are two
    questions; one of them passing says nothing about the other.

    What makes the syntax check load-bearing is where the value lands.
    :func:`get_file` passes it as its own argv element directly after
    ``--version-id``, and that is the first place in this module a version id
    becomes a bare argument rather than a field inside a JSON document (the delete
    path puts it in ``{"Key": ..., "VersionId": ...}``, where nothing can read it
    as anything else). There is no shell involved -- ``engine.run_aws`` spawns a
    fixed argv -- so this is not about shell metacharacters, which an argv list
    already neutralises. It is about the AWS CLI's OWN option grammar: its parser
    reads a leading ``-`` as the start of another option, so a stored id of
    ``--profile`` would silently repoint the call instead of naming a version.
    Refusing a leading ``-`` is what closes that, and a quoted argv cannot.

    The id arrives from ``backup.json``, which is local state this install wrote and
    which is NOT agent-writable: ``apps/aws-control/data`` sits behind the agent
    file-tool floor (``security._CREW_SECRET_LEAVES``) and is bind-masked from every
    agent sandbox (``sandbox._CREW_HIDDEN_LEAVES``). So this check is not standing
    between an agent and the CLI. It is here because the value crosses into an argv
    element where a leading ``-`` changes what the command MEANS, and a stored id is
    read back long after it was written, by which time a truncated or partially
    rewritten file is the ordinary way it goes wrong.

    The shape is as WIDE as S3's own contract and no wider. Version ids are opaque
    URL-ready strings drawn from the full base64 alphabet, so ``+``, ``/`` and ``=``
    all appear in real ones and a narrower alphabet would refuse the recovery read
    for genuine ids -- silently turning this whole path back into the refusal it
    exists to avoid. Printable ASCII without whitespace is the bound, because a
    control character or a newline is not something S3 mints and has no business
    reaching a log line or an argv element. Everything past the first character is
    inert as argv data, so the leading ``-`` is the entire security question and it
    gets its own check below.

#: only when the sandbox that builds it actually runs for the spawn: ``agent.sandbox

#: on the leaf in a SUPPORTED configuration -- ``os.link("~/.aws/credentials",
#: "<staging>/archive.tar.gz")`` substitutes the inode, and because the fingerprint
#: and the upload both read that one descriptor they agree on the substituted bytes.

    ``s3api put-object`` rather than ``s3 cp``: the high-level ``aws s3`` commands
    do not accept ``--expected-bucket-owner`` (checked against their own help
    output), and without it a transfer trusts only the bucket NAME. S3 bucket
    names are globally unique, so a name that becomes free -- our bucket deleted,

    itself reject that, per request, whatever the policy says.

    inverted -- a restore would write a stranger's bytes into the owner's session
    directory -- so the same guard applies.

    ``version`` pins the read to ONE stored version instead of whatever is current
    at that name. Empty -- the default, and what every pre-existing caller passes by
    saying nothing -- keeps the current-version read byte for byte, so this widens
    the primitive without moving any caller that does not ask.

    Naming a version is the read-side half of the argument :func:`put_file` makes
    about recording one. A key is a NAME, the drive is reachable by more than one
    install by design, and versioning is on for exactly that reason: a co-writer
    overwriting a recorded key leaves this install's bytes behind as a noncurrent

    answers.

    Exists for the gateway-proxied text preview: the browser cannot fetch a
    presigned URL itself because the bucket carries no CORS configuration, so
    the gateway reads on its behalf. A ``--range`` bounds the transfer to the
    preview window — S3 answers with the whole object when it is smaller than
    the range, which is the desired behaviour, not an error.

    The full size comes from the same response (``ContentRange``'s total,
    falling back to ``ContentLength``), so the caller can tell a truncated
    preview from a complete one without a second round trip. Owner-pinned
    like every other transfer, for :func:`put_file`'s name-reuse reason.

    The CLI only writes to a path, and a path in a shared temp directory is
    attacker-influenceable: a same-UID process watching that directory can
    swap the file for a link between our create and the CLI's open, and the
    CLI — writing with the gateway's reach — then lands the object bytes on
    whatever the link names. So the file is staged in a fresh private
    directory under :data:`STAGING_DIR_LEAF`, which every agent sandbox masks
    and the shared file-tool gate refuses. That mask would hide the directory
    from the sandboxed CLI as well, so the per-call directory is named in
    ``extra_visible_dirs`` — lifting the mask for this one fixed-argv spawn,
    never for the agent. It is named in EVERY spelling the masks use for the
    crew data home (:func:`sandbox.crew_home_visible_spellings`): the mask list
    carries both ``$HOME``-joined crew-home prefixes as well as the resolved
    ``config_dir()`` path, the lift is decided lexically, and under a symlinked
    ``$HOME`` those are different strings for one directory — so naming only the
    resolved one leaves a surviving mask to bind an empty directory straight back
    over the staged file, and the CLI reports ``ENOENT`` on a path the gateway
    just created.

    Each spelling's staging ROOT is checked before the spawn
    (:func:`sandbox.carveout_shadowed_by_foreign_mask`). That root is the mask
    entry the lift cancels, so the guard's equality rule exempts it and only
    some OTHER masked ancestor refuses — a data home relocated beneath one
    (``KIROCREW_HOME`` under ``~/.gnupg``) would hand this child that whole tree,
    so the transfer is refused instead of run. One shadowed spelling refuses the
    call: the CLI needs every spelling, not a surviving subset. The check is
    skipped only where no mask can exist for reasons that cannot change before
    the spawn — a non-POSIX host, or an ``off`` tier — never on the backend probe,
    whose transient failures are uncached by design and would otherwise skip the
    refusal for a spawn that still applies the lift.

    The mask is a Linux/macOS mechanism; Windows has no sandbox, so there the
    destination is pinned by IDENTITY instead of by hiding, and the pin covers
    the whole path, not just the file. The staging root and then the per-call
    directory are each opened and held (:func:`platform_compat.pin_directory`,
    which refuses a link or reparse point at the name) before anything inside
    them is named: a held directory can be neither renamed nor deleted, nor can
    any directory above it, so the path the CLI writes through cannot be
    re-pointed at a planted junction. Inside it the gateway creates the
    destination itself, exclusively (``O_EXCL`` refuses a name something else
    planted first — a hard link to a sensitive file included) and holds that
    handle open across the CLI call too. After the call the path is re-checked
    against the held file handle (device, inode, link count) and the bytes are
    read back through that handle rather than by reopening the path, so a link
    that appeared anyway is refused rather than followed. The directory is
    removed before returning — nothing of the object outlives the call.

#: ``delete-objects`` accepts at most 1000 keys per request (a hard S3 API
#: limit, not a tunable). A folder with more objects than that MUST be paged,

#: assumption that one call clears the whole prefix.
_DELETE_BATCH_MAX = 1000

#: Byte ceiling for the serialized ``--delete`` document, which travels as ONE
#: argv element. Two limits bound it, and the tighter one wins:
#:
#:   * Linux caps a single argument at MAX_ARG_STRLEN (128 KiB).
#:   * Windows caps the WHOLE command line near 32 KiB (32767 chars) - and
#:     ``subprocess`` builds that line with ``list2cmdline``, which escapes every
#:     ``"`` as ``\"``. An S3 key may legitimately contain quotes (nothing stops
#:     another tool writing one), and a JSON document is quote-dense by
#:     construction, so a batch can DOUBLE on the way to CreateProcess.
#:
#: So the budget is set for the worst case rather than the typical one:
#: 12 KiB * 2 (every byte escaped) + roughly 300 bytes of fixed argv is about
#: 25 KiB, comfortably inside 32767. ``_WINDOWS_CMDLINE_MAX`` and the test that
#: multiplies these together keep the relationship honest if the cap is ever
#: raised - 1000 keys of 1024 chars would otherwise serialize to ~1 MB and fail
#: to spawn at all, which is an OSError and a 500 rather than a delete.
_DELETE_PAYLOAD_MAX_BYTES = 12 * 1024

    Order is preserved and every entry appears exactly once: a split that dropped

    The drive has versioning ENABLED (see the module docstring), and that one
    fact is why this listing exists beside :func:`list_section`.
    ``list-objects-v2`` answers only about CURRENT versions, so a caller that
    deletes what it returns reclaims nothing: :func:`delete_key` without a
    version id writes a delete MARKER, the bytes stay behind it as a noncurrent
    version, and the bucket goes on being billed for every one of them. This is
    the listing a caller needs in order to remove bytes rather than hide them,
    because it names the ``VersionId`` of each version -- the only form
    :func:`delete_object_versions` can actually erase.

    Delete markers come back TAGGED rather than filtered out. A key whose newest
    entry is a marker is not a live object, and a caller that could not see the
    marker would read the older version underneath it as live.

    Keys are section-RELATIVE, like :func:`list_section` and every key this
    package passes around, so a caller can compare one against a key it wrote.
    They are RAW, unlike :func:`list_section`: this is an identity read whose
    answers are compared against keys and then deleted, and a redacted name
    matches no key -- so a caller fed the display listing could read an archive
    that exists as absent.

    ``subpath`` must name a folder. Every caller of this is about to delete, and
    a whole-section version listing is not a blast radius this function hands
    out. The prefix is anchored on :data:`SECTION_PREFIXES` and closed with a
    trailing ``/``, so listing ``snapshots/abc`` cannot reach a sibling
    ``snapshots/abcdef/``.

    Paged with ``--max-items`` and walked to the end of the token chain, so the
    answer is still the COMPLETE set or a raised error, never a first page a
    caller could mistake for the whole prefix. Bounding the PAGE is what keeps the
    peak in memory bounded; bounding the ANSWER is not on offer here, so a prefix
    holding more than :data:`_VERSION_ROWS_MAX` versions RAISES rather than
    returning what fits. An unreadable response raises for the same reason, unlike
    :func:`usage`: an empty list here reads as "nothing worth keeping", and a

    A folder delete is a BLAST-RADIUS decision, so the prefix is constructed
    here, never taken raw: it is ``section_key(section, path)`` plus a trailing
    ``/``. The trailing slash is load-bearing -- deleting under ``drive/photos``
    (no slash) would also sweep a sibling ``drive/photos-backup/``; anchoring on
    ``drive/photos/`` confines the delete to the folder the caller named. The
    caller validates ``path`` with :func:`validate_key` first, which rejects an
    empty or ``/``-only value, so this can never be asked to delete a whole
    section (``drive/``) or the whole bucket.

    S3 caps ``delete-objects`` at 1000 keys per request, so this walks the folder
    in rounds: list one ``list-objects-v2`` window under the prefix
    (owner-pinned), batch-delete the keys it returned, then list AGAIN from the
    prefix -- deliberately WITHOUT ``--starting-token``.

    Resuming with a token would be wrong here. ``--max-items`` is CLIENT-side
    pagination: when the CLI truncates inside a server page it emits a composite
    token carrying an intra-page offset (``boto_truncate_amount``), and S3 is
    free to return a short page, so the CLI may fetch another to reach the
    requested count and truncate mid-page. Resuming then re-lists and skips N
    items -- but those N were just deleted, so the skip lands on SURVIVING keys,
    which are never removed while the call reports completion. Re-listing has no
    offset to get wrong: what was deleted is gone, so the next window starts at
    the next survivor. It is also memory-bounded, unlike collecting every key
    before deleting any.

    The walk therefore depends on each round removing what it listed, which the
    per-key error check guarantees. If a listing ever repeats without shrinking,
    the round made no progress and this raises rather than spinning.

    Each delete is owner-pinned for the same name-reuse reason as every other
    write. On the versioned bucket each removal is a delete MARKER, so 'deleted'
    is recoverable at the S3 layer until a version purge exists -- matching

    """Case-insensitive filename search across one section's whole prefix.

    S3 has no server-side substring filter, so this pages ``list-objects-v2``
    under the section prefix and matches locally — against the ENTIRE
    section-relative key, not just the basename, so ``reports/2026`` finds a
    file by its folder as well as its name. Folder placeholders (keys ending
    in ``/``) are navigation structure, not files, and are skipped.

    Returns ``(results, capped)``. ``capped`` is True when a match BEYOND the
    :data:`SEARCH_MAX_RESULTS` cap was observed and the walk stopped EARLY —
    exactly the cap's worth of hits is a complete result set, not a truncated
    one. The remaining pages are never requested, which is what keeps a broad
    query on a large drive bounded.

    Matching runs on the RAW relative key; the key handed back is run through
    the same egress redactors as :func:`list_section`, because these names
    render in the dashboard and can be authored outside this app.
