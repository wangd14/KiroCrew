#: ``O_NOFOLLOW`` refuses to open a symlink at all, which is what makes the
#: descriptor-pinned add below race-free rather than merely check-then-open. It
#: does not exist on Windows, where the fallback is the ``S_ISREG`` fstat plus the
#: directory pruning: a swap is still caught the moment the descriptor is
#: inspected, it just cannot be refused at open time.
_O_NOFOLLOW = getattr(os, "O_NOFOLLOW", 0)


#: ``O_NONBLOCK`` is what keeps the open itself from being a denial of service.
#: Opening a FIFO for reading BLOCKS until some writer appears, so a single named
#: pipe planted in an agent-writable session directory would hang the backup
#: thread forever -- the fstat that rejects it never gets to run. With this flag
#: the open returns immediately and ``S_ISREG`` does the rejecting. Regular files
#: ignore it, so nothing legitimate changes. Also absent on Windows, which has no
#: FIFOs to open.
_O_NONBLOCK = getattr(os, "O_NONBLOCK", 0)


#: ``O_DIRECTORY`` makes "open this only if it is a directory" atomic with the
#: open, so a pinned descent cannot be tricked into opening a file (or, with
#: ``O_NOFOLLOW`` alongside it, a link) where a directory was expected. Absent on
#: Windows, which is one of the two reasons the fallback walk exists.
_O_DIRECTORY = getattr(os, "O_DIRECTORY", 0)


#: Depth ceiling for the pinned descent. One descriptor is held per level, so a
#: pathological tree could otherwise exhaust the process's fd budget. Session
#: trees are two or three deep; anything past this is not a session layout.
_MAX_TREE_DEPTH = 32


#: Whether this platform can do the pinned traversal at all. Both are needed:

#: Why the sessions (archive) backup is unavailable where the upload body cannot be
#: held unrewritable from creation. The archive path builds its own body, but the
#: hold that makes those bytes safe -- a nameless Linux inode with the same-UID
#: writer excluded from /proc, or a Windows deny-write handle -- cannot be expressed
#: on an unconfined POSIX host, macOS or a BSD, where a same-UID process could still
#: rewrite the body (a nameless inode is reachable through /proc/<pid>/fd). Refused
#: up front here, quoted verbatim, so the owner learns it before a run rather than
#: from a failed run record. Restoring those platforms with a producer-owned sealed
#: handle is tracked as a follow-up.

    The refusal itself is not new -- :func:`run_sessions_backup` has always
    raised on a platform without descriptor-pinned traversal, and that fail-close
    is correct and stays. What was missing is a way to ASK before starting: the
    kind was registered and offered identically everywhere, so on Windows the
    owner pressed a button and got a ``RuntimeError`` back as a failed run
    record. A capability question deserves an answer before the work, not an
    exception after it, so the same condition is readable up front here and the
    route layer turns it into a stated refusal.

    Returns the prose reason so every surface quotes ONE explanation. Callers
    must treat a non-``None`` result as "offer this as unavailable", not as an
    error to log.

    Both kinds are answered here, and each for its own reason: the sessions kind
    needs descriptor-pinned traversal AND an upload body it can hold unrewritable
    from creation, and the snapshot kind needs to hold its payload from creation. A
    kind is unavailable when ITS OWN capability is missing, so one being refused here
