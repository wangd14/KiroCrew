"""Backup — memory/workspace snapshots and session archives on ``backup/``.

Two backup kinds, one push path:

* **Snapshot** (the mockup's "Memory & workspace" row): the existing
  ``kiro_crew.snapshot`` engine builds its portable ``.tar.gz`` (memory,
  crons, config, skills, workspace, notifications, security — its component
  set, unchanged), and the archive is pushed to
  ``backup/snapshots/<install>/<name>.tar.gz``.
* **Sessions archive** (the "Sessions archive" row): one tarball of BOTH
  session halves — ``<data home>/sessions/`` (transcripts + rotated
  archives) and ``<kiro home>/sessions/cli/`` (the CLI replay logs) -- plus a
  table-scoped export of the kiro-cli TERMINAL conversation store (see
  "Terminal conversations" below), pushed to
  ``backup/sessions/<install>/<stamp>.tar.gz``. Whole-set, not per-session:
  the "both halves move together" invariant is honoured by construction, and a
  run whose trees have not moved since the archive already in the drive uploads
  nothing at all -- see "Unchanged runs upload nothing" below. Splitting the set
  into per-session objects and sending only the changed ones is a different
  feature and deliberately not this one: the RFC lists incremental and
  deduplicating transfer among its non-goals.

**Terminal conversations (``conversations/`` root).** The two transcript halves
above are the GATEWAY's session state; the terminal (kiro-cli itself) keeps its
own conversations in ``conversations`` and ``conversations_v2`` inside
``~/.local/share/kiro-cli/data.sqlite3``, a store disjoint from both halves.
That file is ALSO the identity auth store -- ``hooks.py`` classifies it as a
token path and it holds live bearer tokens -- so the archive
must never carry the file. It carries a table-scoped export instead: a fresh
database holding ONLY the tables in ``_CONVERSATION_TABLES`` (an allowlist, so no
identity or token TABLE can leak even if kiro-cli adds one -- the bound is per
table and not per column, see ``_copy_table``), read from the live
store under a single read-only snapshot as ``_export_cli_conversations``
documents, under
the ``conversations/`` archive root beside ``crew`` and ``cli``. The store is
looked up among FIXED, home-anchored locations only: ``XDG_DATA_HOME`` /
``LOCALAPPDATA`` are not consulted, because the fence that keeps agent file tools
out of this store is home-anchored and does not follow a redirected root, and this
archive is uploaded off-host unattended. A host that relocates its store therefore
gets no ``conversations/`` root, and the run record says so through
``conversations_skipped`` rather than leaving an operator to infer it from an
absent member. The DECLARED
BOUNDARY of "conversation state" for this app is exactly the terminal's two chat
tables, ``conversations`` and ``conversations_v2``; a store that has not migrated
holds its rows in the first and a migrated one holds them in the second, so
carrying only one of them would leave an un-migrated install's conversations
behind while the run recorded a store with no conversation table at all.
If a future table is genuinely conversation state and not auth, it is added to
``_CONVERSATION_TABLES`` and this sentence is updated in the same change --
there is no other place the boundary is expressed. The export rides the SAME
standing permission as the ``cli`` half, :func:`sessions_layer_b_enabled`, and
invents no new grant: both carry what a model actually held, where
the crew transcript carries what was displayed with display-time redaction
applied. Neither is shipped raw: every text column of an exported conversation row
goes through ``_redacted_row`` first, so what leaves the host is
EGRESS-REDACTED, so an install whose operator withholds Layer B gets an archive with no
``conversations/`` root either. Reading the store is RECORDED through the
sanctioned credential-read audit
(``hooks.emit_internal_read_audit`` under ``aws_control.conversation_export``,
registered in ``hooks._AUDIT_ONLY_READ_IDS``), which runs after the read rather
than gating it -- it is an access log, not an authorization. What FAILS CLOSED is
the SHIPPING: an export whose
access cannot be recorded is dropped from the archive rather than shipped
unaudited, because the file holds live bearer tokens whatever this reader
touches.

**One drive can be reached by several installs.** Discovery is by tag, so a
second install finds the first one's bucket and writes to it by design — the
``<install>`` segment is what keeps the two apart afterwards, and it is a
random per-install id held in this app's own state, never the telemetry
install id. An archive uploaded before that segment existed carries no id and
is reported as being of unknown origin rather than claimed by whoever is
reading. The "install identity" note in ``backup_parts.identity`` says why the id
decides what is permitted while the human-readable label decides only what is
displayed.

**Restore is a download, deliberately.** A restore lands the archive in
``<app data dir>/restore/`` and hands back the path; nothing hot-swaps a
live ``memory.db`` or sessions dir under a running gateway. The snapshot
engine's own merge/replace tooling (or a stopped gateway) takes it from
there, and the UI copy says exactly that.

State (`<app data dir>/backup.json`): this install's identity, plus the last
run per kind, the nightly toggle per account, and the per-account retention
count. The nightly loop lives in the app's ``on_startup`` hook.

**Unchanged runs upload nothing.** Every run builds its archive, then asks whether
that archive carries anything the drive does not already hold; if not, it records a
run saying so and sends no bytes. The comparison CANNOT be over archive bytes -- a
``tar.gz`` embeds per-entry mtimes and a gzip stamp, so two runs over an identical
tree produce different bytes and an archive-level check would report "changed" every
night. It is taken over the entry set instead (path, kind, permission mode, size and
content hash per member: ``_tree_fingerprint``), read from the packed payload so it
cannot drift from what would actually be sent. A skip is refused unless the previous
archive is PROVEN still in the drive at its recorded key and its recorded length,
because a record proves only that this install once wrote that key -- retention
deletes by design and a co-writer can overwrite a name. Every uncertain branch
uploads. See ``_unchanged_baseline``, which lists them.

**Retention runs after a successful push, never before it.** Both key shapes
above carry a timestamp, so nothing is ever overwritten and an unbounded drive
was the default: a nightly backup added one archive a night forever. Each push
therefore ends by retiring this install's oldest archives OF THAT KIND, but only
once an operator has set a count: retention is opt-in, and with no usable count
every archive is kept. The bucket is
versioned, so the sweep deletes object VERSIONS rather than objects -- a plain
delete would leave a marker and go on billing for the bytes behind it. It is
best-effort: a cleanup that fails logs one line and leaves the successful backup
alone. See ``_prune_remote_archives``.

**One import path over private owners.** This module is the engine's only import
path and its only patch surface. The responsibilities it composes live in
``backup_parts``, lowest layer first:

* ``egress_text`` -- the one redaction sequence for text that is published or shown;
* ``state`` -- ``backup.json``, its locks and lock order, the recovery overlay;
* ``identity`` -- the install id and label, and the archive key namespace;
* ``fingerprints`` -- body, tree and version-id proof;
* ``traversal`` -- the descriptor-pinned walk and the platform capability;
* ``ledger`` -- run records, and what this install uploaded;
* ``layer_b`` -- the Layer B grant and its scope;
* ``nightly`` -- the unattended grants, failure records, backoff and due-ness;
* ``uploads`` -- the upload gate, the recovery-read gate and the skip proof;
* ``catalog`` -- remote listings;
* ``retention`` -- the opt-in sweep.

What stays here is what those owners are composed INTO: both archive builders and
every outbound archive and label PUT, the terminal conversation export, the
screened tree walk, the staged restore, and the Job SDK runner. Several of these
are pinned to this file by name: the link-screen baseline declares four of their
functions, and the redaction-sink registry names this module as the backup
boundary. Every owner's names resolve here, and a write through this module reaches
every module holding the name, so patching ``backup.X`` changes what the engine runs
wherever that name is read. The composition note at the end of this module says how,
and what a patch harness sees of it.

CALLER CONTRACT: handlers hold the consent gate; sync, subprocess/tar-bound
— call via ``asyncio.to_thread`` (pushes of a large sessions set can run
minutes; handlers use generous timeouts).

    The archive path creates its own file and holds it, so on every platform the
    bytes that are digested are the bytes that are uploaded. The snapshot path
    cannot: ``snapshot_main`` and :func:`snapshot.prepare_redacted_copy` create and
    close the payload by name, and only afterwards can this module open it. On POSIX
    that gap is covered by the sandbox mask over the staging leaf, which removes the
    writer entirely. On a platform with no such mask the writer is present, and the
    checks available after the fact -- a regular file, singly named, owned by this
    user -- all pass for a same-user replacement, while the fingerprint and the
    upload then read the substituted descriptor and agree with each other.

    provenance cannot be established. Refusing is the conservative direction: an
    operator who gets no backup knows they have none, whereas one who gets a
    substituted backup believes they are covered and finds out at restore, off-host,
    with nothing left to compare against.

    Archive backups are not affected by this refusal. Whether the sessions kind runs
    on a given platform is a separate capability question with its own answer, so
    neither this refusal nor its prose speaks for it. Removing this refusal is tracked
    as producer-owned deny-write handles for both snapshot producers.

    The same condition is readable BEFORE a run starts, through
    :func:`kind_unavailable_reason`, which quotes this refusal's own reason. That
    matters more than it looks: without it the route starts a run, this helper raises

def _kiro_cli_conversation_db() -> tuple[Path | None, str]:
    r"""This host's kiro-cli store, and why there is none when there is none.

    Resolved through :func:`identity_stores.state_db_candidates` against FIXED,
    home-anchored locations. The environment is deliberately NOT consulted -- not
    ``XDG_DATA_HOME`` on POSIX, not ``LOCALAPPDATA`` or ``APPDATA`` on Windows --
    which is why an empty mapping is passed rather than ``os.environ``.

    **Why a relocated store is skipped rather than found.** The fence that makes
    this store unreadable and unwritable by agent file tools is home-anchored:
    ``security.paths`` splices in :func:`identity_stores.fenced_home_dirs`, and its
    own comment records that "a profile redirected outside the home directory is
    not covered". So a store re-rooted by one of those variables sits OUTSIDE the
    fence, where an agent can author rows. This function feeds an archive that is
    uploaded off-host unattended, so honouring the variable would let an agent
    plant rows in a ``conversations_v2`` table at a location it may write and have
    a scheduled backup ship them. An uploaded object cannot be un-sent.
    :func:`kiro_prerequisite` records the same decision for the same two variables
    and states the rule this follows: a fixed anchor cannot be pointed at
    something the agent may write. Being wrong in this direction costs a
    relocated-store install its terminal conversations, which the run record shows
    as an absent ``conversations/`` root; being wrong in the other direction
    uploads agent-authored content and cannot be undone.

    The candidates come back current-platform, most likely first, deduped; the
    first that is a regular file reached through no redirection is this host's.

    **The second return value says WHY no store was used, and it is never empty when
    none was.** It is a reason string, and the caller suppresses the retention sweep on
    any reason, so each of these cases keeps an earlier archive alive rather than
    letting this run retire it. Three cases reach it, and none is exotic:
    ``store_rejected_link`` for a candidate refused by either redirection test -- and
    the ancestor walk rejects on ANY parent from ``/`` down, including the home
    directory, so an ordinary symlinked ``~/.local/share`` or a symlinked home takes
    this exit permanently -- ``store_unreadable`` for one whose stat raised ``OSError``,
    and ``store_absent`` when nothing is at any fenced location.

    Absence reports a reason for a reason worth stating, since the opposite reads as
    obvious: the question the caller asks is whether an EARLIER archive holds rows this
    one does not, which is about backup history rather than about what is on disk now. A
    store wiped to clear corruption, removed by a reinstall, or on a volume not mounted
    at nightly-run time was present when last week's archive was written. Nothing pins a
    store's presence from one run to the next, so a per-run observation cannot answer
    the question, and answering it optimistically erases the last archive that held the
    conversations.

    **The ORDER of the two redirection tests and the file test is the guard, not a
    detail.** ``is_file()`` on a LOCAL-looking path whose ANCESTOR is a junction to
    ``\\host\share`` opens an outbound SMB connection that authenticates as this
    process, and it does so inside the stat itself -- before any check of ours can
    reject anything. So the ancestor walk runs FIRST, on every candidate, before
    the path is stat-ed at all. :func:`platform_compat.first_linked_ancestor` tests
    ancestors root-first and stops at the first link, so the walk never traverses
    one either. It deliberately excludes the leaf, which is why
    :func:`platform_compat.is_link_or_junction` still tests the candidate itself:
    ``islink`` alone answers False for a Windows junction, so a bare symlink check
    would accept a junction and read the store it points at instead of this host's.
    A fixed anchor bounds where a candidate may live; it does not stop a link
    planted AT that anchor from redirecting the read, so both guards are needed.

    failure this answers: an operator whose store lives outside home would believe
    an archive holds their terminal conversations when it holds none, and nothing in
    the run record would say otherwise.

    Compares the two candidate sets by PATH and touches the filesystem not at all --
    no ``stat``, no open, nothing. That is deliberate rather than incidental: the
    relocated root is outside the agent-file-tool fence, and probing a path there is
    the very thing the ancestor guard in :func:`_kiro_cli_conversation_db` exists to
    stop. A set difference needs no probe, so this reports the condition without
    reproducing the risk.

    True means "the environment names at least one store location this export will
    not read". It does NOT mean a store exists there; that question cannot be
    answered without a probe, and is not worth one. Reporting the relocation is
    enough for an operator to understand an absent ``conversations/`` root, which is

    :func:`identity_stores.state_db_candidates` does not follow that variable -- "the
    current generation writes the ``LOCALAPPDATA`` location, and the roaming default
    is retained only as a legacy fallback". A store kiro-cli does not write to cannot
    be relocated away from this export, so an ``APPDATA`` mismatch is not evidence of
    a relocation. Comparing it anyway reported one on any host with a redirected
    Roaming folder, which is an ordinary enterprise configuration, and that false
    positive froze retention permanently while a readable Local store sat beside it
    inside the fence. Nothing is lost by leaving it out: a legacy install that really
    does keep its store at a redirected Roaming root has no store at either fixed
    candidate, so the lookup reports ``store_absent`` and the sweep is suppressed on

def _export_cli_conversations(tar: tarfile.TarFile) -> _ConversationExport:
    """Export ONLY the terminal conversation tables into ``tar``. Returns row count.

    ``data.sqlite3`` is BOTH the terminal's conversation store and its identity
    auth store: ``hooks.py`` classifies the file as a token path and it
    holds live bearer tokens. Tar-ing the file would upload live
    credentials off-host, strictly worse than the gap this closes. So this reads
    the source and writes a FRESH database holding only :data:`_CONVERSATION_TABLES`
    -- an allowlist, so no byte of any table OUTSIDE it (no identity row, no token
    column of an auth table) can reach the archive even if kiro-cli adds a
    credential table later. The bound is per TABLE, not per column: every column an
    allowlisted table declares is copied, so a credential column added to
    ``conversations_v2`` itself would ride. See :func:`_copy_table`.

    **The source is a LIVE WAL-mode database, so a consistent read needs care.**
    A commit lands in the ``-wal`` sidecar and folds into the main file only on a
    checkpoint, so the main file and its ``-wal`` only agree at an instant. The
    safe read does NOT copy those files, and does NOT checkpoint: a checkpoint is
    a WRITE, and this opens the operator's store ``mode=ro``, on which a
    ``wal_checkpoint`` cannot run. What a read-only connection DOES give is a
    consistent WAL-aware view -- SQLite applies the committed ``-wal`` frames
    transparently on read -- so the whole export runs inside ONE explicit read
    transaction (``BEGIN``), which pins a single snapshot for the life of the
    copy. Every allowlisted table is then read against that one snapshot, so a
    writer committing mid-copy cannot make two tables disagree. This is why
    copying the ``-wal`` and then the main file separately would be wrong: it
    takes them at two different times, and a WAL copied before its commit was
    checkpointed replays over newer pages so the archive restores BACKWARDS.

    Steps:

    1. Open the source READ-ONLY (``mode=ro``) so this writes no database page and
       runs no checkpoint against the operator's live store. It is not a promise of
       zero filesystem writes: on a WAL store SQLite may still update the ``-shm``
       shared-memory sidecar to take a read mark, which is how a reader
       participates in WAL at all. The store's own DATA is what is untouchable
       here. Open one deferred read transaction so all reads share a single
       consistent snapshot including committed WAL frames.
    2. Copy the allowlisted tables through a named per-table column list, which
       fixes a stable column order for the copy -- see :func:`_copy_table` for what
       that does and does not bound, since the list is derived from the source's
       declared columns and is not a column allowlist. The fail-closed boundary is
       the TABLE allowlist in :data:`_CONVERSATION_TABLES`.

    Best-effort at the STORE level (a missing store, an unreadable one, a store that
    cannot be resolved at all) -- those
    return an empty :class:`_ConversationExport` and the sessions backup proceeds
    with the transcript halves. NOT
    best-effort at the ROW level: once a readable store is found, every row of
    every allowlisted table is copied and counted, and the manifest's count is
    asserted against the source in the tests, so a partial copy fails loudly
    rather than shipping a short archive.

    **One exit deliberately does NOT report a skip: a failure while WRITING the
    members into the tar.** ``tarfile.addfile`` raising part-way leaves the archive in
    an undefined state, so swallowing it would upload a damaged tarball under a record
    saying the run succeeded -- worse than the failure it hides, and the one case where
    losing the whole archive is the correct outcome. Everything before the first tar
    write is guarded and reports; from the first tar write onward, an
    exception propagates.

            # The attended owner's withheld run is the one shape with neither: both
            # scheduled-only re-reads are skipped, the recheck short-circuits, and what
            # remains -- `is_app_enabled`, `aws_consent`, STS -- is not stored in this

            # `_authorize_upload` and `put_file` sit adjacent with no blocking call
            # between them. Taking one costs what an exclusive hold costs -- the lock
            # file is `_state_path()`'s sidecar, one path for every account, so every
            # state writer of every account (`_record_run`, `set_sessions_layer_b`,
            # `set_retention_keep`, the nightly loop) waits out this upload up to
            # `_STATE_LOCK_TIMEOUT_SECS` for a guarantee this one path does not need.
            # `contextlib.nullcontext` keeps that as one expression, so the body below
            # reads the same either way.
            #
            # `_upload_lock`, not `_state_lock`: the sidecar FILE lock alone, without
            # `_run_lock`. The setters (`set_sessions_layer_b` and `set_nightly_sessions`,
            # each -> `_locked_state_update` -> `_state_lock`) take this same file lock
            # exclusively, so an exclusive hold here still orders a revocation wholly
            # before or wholly after this block, in this process and in a second install
            # writing the same state -- the guarantee this gate exists for is untouched.
            # `_run_lock` ALSO
            # serializes `last_runs`, which the dashboard's backup-status read goes
            # through, so holding it across a PUT allowed `_PUSH_TIMEOUT_SECS` would
            # stall every account's status surface for one account's upload -- which is

            # `_delete_under_the_retention_gate`: it composes the sidecar file lock with
            # a dedicated gate rather than `_run_lock`, so a purge does not stall the
            # status read either.
            #
            # Nothing inside the block re-enters this lock. `_authorize_upload` reaches
            # `is_app_enabled`, `aws_consent`, an STS call, `_refuse_upload`, and -- for a
            # scheduled caller -- the unattended grant readers and
            # `scheduled_sessions_blocked_reason`. The last two READ this module's state
            # file, which is what the hold above orders them against, but they read it
            # without taking the lock, so naming them here costs no reentrancy. The list
            # is written out in full deliberately: a list that stops at STS reads as
            # though the withheld path has no permission left to lose, which is the
            # reasoning the hold above exists to refuse.
            #
            # The run record is written after the block. `_record_run` reaches the
            # same file lock through `_state_lock`, but only after this block has
            # released, and it holds no `_run_lock` while it waits for it -- so it
            # cannot deadlock against this block and it cannot drag the status read in
            # with it. Both halves of that are load-bearing: omitting `_run_lock` HERE
            # is not enough on its own, because the stall arrives through the contending
            # writer rather than through this block. See the lock-order note above

            # It does NOT over-suppress, but the line is not where it first looks. What may
            # stay reasonless is a run that READ everything the host holds, or one where the
            # operator withheld the permission -- a consented withdrawal, and the default,
            # so an ordinary install prunes exactly as it did before this feature existed.
            # An ABSENT store does not qualify: the question is whether an earlier archive
            # holds rows this one does not, and a store missing at nightly-run time may have
            # been present when that archive was written. The accepted cost is narrow
            # because the permission is owner-gated and defaults off -- only a host that
            # opted INTO conversation backup and has no store to back up stops pruning, and
            # that combination is a misconfiguration the record now names rather than a
            # working state.

            # THE DECLINE IS AUDITED. Suppressing the sweep suppresses the DELETION, never
            # the record of the decision: `_audit_retention` is only reachable from inside
            # `_prune_remote_archives`, so an early return here would have filed no SEL
            # event at all, on the one path in the app that erases object versions for good
            # -- exactly the invisibility that function exists to prevent, and its contract
            # says every terminal outcome files one "including the ones that deleted
            # nothing". A decline is a terminal outcome. It is filed as `failed` with the
            # reason as `error`, matching the sweep's own refusal-to-act on a listing that
            # does not show the archive just uploaded: nothing was deleted and the operator
            # needs to know why, which is not the same as a withdrawn consent (`denied`
            # belongs to the gate). This is also what keeps the accumulation VISIBLE: while
            # the condition persists the archives pile up past the keep count, and one event
            # per run naming the reason is how an auditor sees that rather than inferring it
            # from a sweep that silently never ran.
            # TWO independent conditions, not one replacing the other. The first is this
            # run's own export coming up short, which is the `skipped` reason above. The
            # second is this run carrying no conversations at all while an older RETAINED
            # archive carries them -- which the grant's own scope can produce with nothing
            # wrong: an in-scope run uploads conversations, the scope is then narrowed, and
            # the next run's archive omits them while the sweep would retire the one that
            # holds them. That path sets no skip reason, because a scope the operator
            # narrowed is a policy decline rather than a failed read, so the first condition
            # cannot see it.
            #

def make_job_runner(sdk: Any, kind: str) -> Any:
    """Build the Job SDK runner for ``kind``. Registered once, at app startup.

    A PLAIN ``def``, and it must stay one. ``JobSDK._execute`` calls the runner
    and DISCARDS its return value, so an ``async def`` here would hand back a
    coroutine nobody awaits: the body would never execute, nothing would raise,
    and the record would settle on ``done`` reporting a backup that never
    happened. ``register()`` validates the kind and not the callable, so this
    property is the app's to keep.

    That constraint is what shapes the resolution below. The SDK gives a runner
    its handle and nothing else -- there is no ``params`` channel in P1 -- so the
    run's target is read back out of its own record, where ``start`` put it:

    * The ACCOUNT comes from ``dedupe_key``. It is the right carrier on its own
      merits, because the account is exactly this run's concurrency identity --
      two snapshot backups of one account must not both do the paid upload, and
      the SDK's index is ``(kind, dedupe_key)`` so snapshot and sessions for the
      same account still run independently. It is also the only field a runner
      can read without a private attribute (``get`` is public; the key is
      withheld from the HTTP view and never logged by the SDK).
    * profile/region/bucket are RE-RESOLVED here rather than carried, which is
      the rule this app already documents for the nightly loop: the drive is
      tag-discovered per run rather than trusted from memory.

    Every resolution step is therefore sync. ``accounts.resolve_account_profile``
    and ``aws_consent.authorize`` are coroutines and are NOT reachable from a
    worker thread -- ``asyncio.run`` would build a second event loop, which is
    the failure this package already carries a ``LoopBoundLock`` to avoid
    -- so this uses the sync cached resolver and lets the sync
    :func:`_authorize_upload` gate inside each runner make the paid-service
    decision. That gate is the real one: it re-checks the LIVE account against
    the target, that the app is still enabled, that S3 consent still holds for
    this profile+region, and that the recorded grant names THIS account, all
    immediately before ``put_file``. So a run started through the generic
    ``_jobs`` surface, which does not pass this app's HTTP pre-flight, is
    authorized by the same gate as one started through it.

    Refusals raise. ``_execute`` records the exception's text as the run's
    ``error`` and the status as ``failed``, which is the honest terminal state
    for a request that named no reachable target. The messages deliberately do
    NOT quote the dedupe key: it is caller-supplied, and the SDK withholds it
    from both the log and the HTTP view for that reason.

    failure means a co-writer overwrote a key this install recorded -- the drive is
    reachable by every install pointed at the account, versioning is on for exactly
    that reason, and an overwrite leaves our bytes behind as a noncurrent version.
    Before this, no code path could ask for them: :func:`storage.get_file` named no
    version, so a restore read whatever was current and the operator's own archive
    sat on the drive, intact and unreachable.

    Returns a path to a temp file holding bytes that PASSED the same fingerprint,
    never a path to bytes that merely arrived. ``None`` means the caller should fall
    back to the refusal it would have raised anyway, so every uncertain branch
    returns ``None``:

    * No recorded fingerprint to compare against. An empty one matches nothing, and
      unknown is not a pass -- the same rule the rest of the backup engine applies.
    * No recorded version for this key, or one that names a version SLOT rather
      than one version (see :func:`_is_provable_version_id`, which rejects
      ``"null"``: a suspended-versioning bucket gives that id to every write, so
      two different bodies at one key both report it).
    * A recorded version that is not well-formed enough to pass to the CLI at all
      (see :func:`storage.validate_version_id`).
    * The read is not authorized at the moment it would be made -- see
      :func:`_authorize_recovery_read`. The extra read is the one AWS call in a
      restore the caller did not ask for, so a disabled app, a withdrawn grant, a
      grant naming another account, or a profile repointed during the first download
      all stop it.
    * The version is gone -- deleted, expired out of the keep window, or never
      there. AWS answers with an error and it is reported as a refusal, not raised:
      for this caller an unusable recorded id is a refusal to report, not a fault.
    * The bytes came back and do NOT match the fingerprint. This is the case worth
      being precise about: it is not a recovery that failed, it is a second set of
      foreign bytes, and it is discarded exactly like the first.

    A fingerprint match is the WHOLE test, and nothing else is asked of the bytes.
    Whether they still open as a ``tar.gz`` is a different question, and one this
    module answers the same way everywhere: the current-version read accepts on the
    fingerprint alone, and the upload side pushes payloads it cannot read
    (:func:`_tree_fingerprint` returns ``""`` for an unreadable ``tar.gz``), so a
    recorded fingerprint can honestly name a malformed archive. Refusing one HERE
    would mean the operator gets their own archive when nobody overwrote the key and
    a refusal when somebody did, for the same bytes -- so this path hands back what
    the fingerprint proves is theirs, exactly as the other one does.

    Never widens what a restore will accept. The fingerprint is re-taken over the
    bytes that actually arrived on THIS read rather than carried over from the
    first, so the pin is on the object in hand and not on a claim about it.

    Exactly one extra read, and only on a path that was already going to refuse.
    There is no loop and no walk of the version list: the recorded id names one
    version, and if that one is not there this install has nothing to recover.
    Costing a second request on the way to the same refusal is the worst case.

    The id comes from local state, which is where a version id can be trusted from
    -- it is written by this install's own successful push, and
    ``apps/aws-control/data`` is neither agent-readable nor agent-writable (it sits
    behind the agent file-tool floor and is bind-masked from every agent sandbox). It
    is still validated on the way OUT, because a stored value read back later can be
    truncated or partially rewritten, and it travels as a separate argv element where
    a leading ``-`` would change what the command means. There is no shell in the
    path.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Composition: one import path and one patch surface over the owners
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# The engine is split by responsibility across ``backup_parts``, and this module is
# its only import path. Callers and tests reach every name as ``backup.X`` -- private
# helpers included, because tests read and patch them -- so two properties hold.
#
# 1. A read answers with the object the owner holds. A name this module does not use
#    itself is NOT bound here: ``__getattr__`` reads it from its owner on each
#    access, through ``sys.modules``, which is the one-storage rule
#    ``test_mirrored_owner_storage.py`` enforces on every module of this shape. The
#    names this module's own functions use are bound here by ordinary imports, the
#    same way each part binds what it imports from a lower part.
# 2. A write reaches every binding of the name. A part resolves a name through its
#    own globals, and so does every part that imported it, so a patch that landed
#    only on this module would leave the code under test running the unpatched
#    object -- the test would pass while testing nothing. ``_Facade`` therefore writes
#    the value into every module that holds the name, which keeps the engine one
#    namespace for writes: shadowing a builtin reaches every part as well. Patch the
#    facade, never a part directly: a write into one part reaches no other holder.
#
# One consequence of (1) is visible to a patch harness. ``mock.patch`` undoes a name
# this module does not bind by deleting it and then writing the original back -- and
# under ``create=True`` it only deletes -- and the delete reaches every holder. So a
# patch of such a name never passes ``create=True`` (the composition-contract test fails
# on any test module that patches a forwarded name with ``create=True``, apart from its
# one allowlisted premise case), and a thread started inside it is joined before the
# patch ends.
#
# The machinery below holds dotted module NAMES, never module objects, and reads
# ``sys``, ``importlib`` and ``builtins`` through private aliases a patch of
# ``backup.sys`` cannot redirect. The composition-contract test pins that every
# module holding a name holds the SAME object, so a name and the symbol it denotes
# cannot come apart.

#: The owners, lowest layer first. A part imports only parts earlier in this order,

#: name a part imports from outside the package resolves from its first importer,
