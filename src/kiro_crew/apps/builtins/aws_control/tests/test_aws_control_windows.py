"""Windows-support tests for the ``aws-control`` builtin app.

Two things are pinned here.

**The manifest declaration.** ``aws-control``'s backend is in-process (hooks +
routes loaded inside the gateway, no ``backend.type`` launcher), and its Python
was already written cross-platform: ``platform_compat.IS_POSIX`` branches around
``chmod``, ``getattr(os, "O_NOFOLLOW", 0)`` for the flags Windows lacks,
``platform_compat.pin_directory`` / ``file_lock`` / ``is_link_or_junction``
instead of raw POSIX calls, ``tempfile`` instead of ``/tmp``, and the standard
library's ``tarfile`` instead of shelling out to ``tar``. ``platform.os`` is a
published capability label, not an enable gate -- ``apps/routes.py`` only calls
``supports_platform`` for a ``platform.installMode == "client"`` app, which no
builtin sets, so an absent or wrong ``platform`` block never actually blocked
this app from running on Windows; it only misinformed the App Store detail
page a user reads before enabling it.

**The one feature that genuinely cannot run there.** The sessions backup archives
agent-writable directories and uploads them unattended, so it walks the tree
descriptor-pinned (``openat``) and REFUSES rather than falling back to a
name-based walk that a junction swapped in mid-descent could redirect. Windows
has neither ``dir_fd`` support nor an fd-accepting ``os.scandir``, so the refusal
is permanent there. These tests pin that the condition is answerable BEFORE the
work rather than only as a ``RuntimeError`` inside a failed run record after the
owner presses the button, that both surfaces quote one explanation, and that the
snapshot backup is untouched by it.

Everything resolves relative to this file, so the suite is machine independent.
