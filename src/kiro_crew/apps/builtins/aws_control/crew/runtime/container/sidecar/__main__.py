"""The backup process: a cycle every interval, and one more on the way out.

Run as ``python -m container.sidecar``. The supervisor starts it after the front, and
only when a bucket is configured: with no bucket there is nothing to write to, which is
a crew running without durability rather than a fault.

## A failed cycle does not end the process

This is the one place where the obvious posture is the wrong one. A process that exits
on a failed upload would be reported to the supervisor as a dead child, the task would
be torn down, and the replacement would come up without the turns the cycle had not
yet written -- so the response to "the backup failed" would be to destroy the data the
backup exists to protect.

So a cycle that fails is logged at ERROR and the loop continues. The next cycle
re-uploads everything still unrecorded, because the fingerprint map only remembers
uploads that SUCCEEDED. A throttled bucket or a brief credential gap costs latency on
the durability window, not the window's contents.

## A bucket that cannot be written at all DOES end the process

The exception is a failure no retry resolves: a denied ``PutObject``, a bucket name
that does not exist, a credential that is not valid. Retrying those is worse than
exiting, because the log fills with attempts while the task keeps taking turns that
nothing will ever save -- the appearance of durability, which is the one failure this
pair exists to remove. The store classifies them as ``StoreUnusable`` and this process
ends on it, so the fault is reported instead of accumulating silently.

The process also exits non-zero if it cannot work at all -- no bucket, unreadable
configuration -- for the same reason: those are deployment mistakes that will not
resolve by retrying, and a task whose sidecar is silently absent has the appearance of
durability. The supervisor treats this child's death as fatal because a crew that keeps
serving with no writer accumulates an unbounded amount of state nothing will save, and
losing at most one interval loudly is better than losing everything quietly.

## The final cycle

SIGTERM interrupts the wait and the loop runs one more cycle -- one that BEGINS after
the signal was observed, and whose completion the process waits for before returning.
That ordering is the whole point. A cycle already in flight when the signal arrives
started before the backend's flush, so it cannot contain what that flush produced;
accepting it as the final one would lose exactly the turns the final cycle exists to
save. On an orderly replacement -- the common case, since a deploy is one -- the
supervisor drains the front so no new turn arrives, then the backend so it flushes what
it holds, and only then this process, whose last act is to upload what that flush
wrote. A post-stop cycle that does not complete exits non-zero rather than reporting a
clean stop.
