"""Launching the Kiro Crew backend headless, and knowing when it is ready.

The deployed unit is Kiro Crew's own backend, run in *dashboard mode*, on
loopback, with no interface served (`docs/system-specs/modules/aws-control.md`,
"Four processes, one task"). Dashboard mode is
required and `--no-dashboard` is wrong: the smaller ``_init_api_server`` it
starts has neither the chat endpoints nor the slot registry this design calls,
and it quiets nothing, so headless here means "no interface exposed", not
"--no-dashboard".

Launch decisions, all from the contract and design:

- Bind ``common.BACKEND_HOST`` (127.0.0.1, not configurable). The gateway binds
  loopback by default; we also pass it explicitly so the intent is recorded.
- ``--no-crons``. Arming the scheduler fires any *overdue* job immediately, so a
  freshly deployed crew would run a stale job on boot.
- Serve no messaging channel. ``write_backend_config`` writes a config the
  container owns that turns every transport off by name, and the launch env carries
  no channel credential. Both halves are needed: two transports need no credential
  and start on their config flag, and Slack has no config flag and starts on its
  tokens.
- ``telemetry.beacon_enabled=false``.
- The boot update check cannot be disabled by config (R4). We do not fight it;
  it is recorded as a known outbound request in the report, not suppressed here.

Readiness means the port answers AND the boot secret file exists. Process-alive
is not ready, and this check deliberately proves no more than that: a present
model key is not a working one, so a container can be "ready" here and still
fail every turn on an invalid key. We do not claim otherwise.

VERIFIED against the installed Kiro Crew (0.3.0) by booting a real
backend through this code on an isolated KIROCREW_HOME (port 8803): the argv
``python -m kiro_crew gateway --no-crons`` boots dashboard mode; ``KIROCREW_PORT``
sets the port (dashboard/urls.py:116), ``KIROCREW_BIND`` pins the address
(urls.py:208), ``KIROCREW_TELEMETRY_DISABLED`` disables the beacon (beacon.py),
the secret lands at ``<KIROCREW_HOME>/run/gateway-<port>.secret`` exactly where
``common.secret_path`` looks, and the listener came up on 127.0.0.1 only.

STILL NOT VERIFIABLE FROM HERE: the backend refuses turns with 503
``kiro_prerequisite_required`` until Kiro CLI is signed in, and this host has no
usable sandbox backend (``unshare(CLONE_NEWUSER)`` EPERM), so a real kiro-cli
worker could not be spawned -- the escaped-worker teardown is proven only by the
topology tests, not against a live worker. The boot update check also runs
regardless of config (R4): on this git install it only "notifies", but a
pip-installed container image may make an outbound probe.

#: The variables that hand an AWS credential to anything that reads the environment.
#:
#: On Fargate the task role is not a file or a key: it is an HTTP endpoint named by

#: asked. The backend spawns the model subprocess with this environment, and that
#: subprocess auto-approves every tool it calls -- the same premise that

#: environment, curl it, and act as the task role: read the transcript bucket, and reach
#: whatever else the role is granted. Keeping it out of the environment closes that
#: independently of the sandbox.
#:
#: Removing them is not a loss for the backend. It reaches the model through the vault
#: rather than through its environment, and nothing in AWS; the SUPERVISOR is what uses
#: the task role, and it keeps its own ``os.environ`` untouched. A container that
#: genuinely needs an AWS call on the turn path should be given a narrower credential
#: explicitly rather than inherit the task's.

#: The `agent` settings the container WRITES rather than inherits, and the reason
#: they are here rather than left to their defaults.
#:
#: `config.json` arrives in the task from outside this code, so every one of these is
#: a posture the container states rather than hopes for. Written, not merged, not
#: defaulted -- exactly as the channel sections are.
#:
#: `acp_backend` selects the KAS harness, which is what keeps the model credential out
#: of the worker's environment. `acp/harness/kas.KasHarness.apply_spawn_env` strips the
#: API key from the relay's environment and the relay asks the host for a token
#: instead, which `acp/kas_host_auth.answer_get_access_token` answers from the vault.
#: Leaving this to the default would make the credential's location a property of
#: whatever `config.json` the task was given, and `build_backend_env` withholding the
#: credential would then starve a relay that owns its own auth.
#:
#: The three sandbox keys are all at their protective values, and the reason is a
#: measurement rather than caution. Taking the credential out of the worker's
#: environment does NOT put it out of the worker's reach: the backend answers the
#: engine's token request from the vault, so the backend's uid must be able to decrypt
#: it, and the worker is a child of the backend under that same uid. A uid-1000 process
#: reads and decrypts that vault directly. Residency in the environment is therefore
#: not the property that makes an unsandboxed worker safe -- reachability by its uid is,
#: and the backend has to reach the credential for any turn to run at all.
#:
#: So `sandbox_allow_unsandboxed_exec` stays false. An unsandboxed auto-approved worker
#: on untrusted prompt content still has a route to the credential, and the routes that
#: remain are not closable from this file: a user namespace, a worker under a different
#: uid from the BACKEND (the gateway's own spawn path, not this container's), or a
#: credential not worth stealing (short-lived and narrowly scoped, issued to the task
#: rather than to a process).
#:
#: Defaults are not a substitute for writing them. `sandbox_allow_unsandboxed_exec`
#: resolves an UNDECLARED value through `unsandboxed_exec_platform_default()`, so
#: what silence means is a property of the platform rather than a constant.
#:
#: `test/test_crew_container_config_isolation.py` ratchets the sandbox keys against
#: `AgentConfig`, so a sandbox knob added to the gateway reds CI until the container
#: decides what to write for it.

#: What the INTERNAL-ONLY boundary loosens, applied over the baseline above and only
#: when the deployment claims that boundary (``SMC_INTERNAL_ONLY``).
#:
#: A separate constant rather than a conditional value inside
#: :data:`FORCED_AGENT_SETTINGS`, because the two answer different questions and the
#: ratchet over them must not be one rule. The baseline is what EVERY container gets
#: and stays universally protective -- ``test_no_sandbox_setting_is_forced_to_a_permissive_value``
#: still reads it and still requires every boolean to be ``False``, so loosening a
#: setting there reds exactly as it did before this constant existed. This one is a
#: named, reviewable exception whose own tests assert it is reachable ONLY through the
#: flag. Folding the exception into the baseline would have made the ratchet's
#: universal assertion impossible to state at all, which is how a security test becomes
#: an allowlist.
#:
#: ``sandbox_allow_unsandboxed_exec`` is a FAIL-OPEN switch, not a sandbox-off switch:
#: ``wrap_argv`` still sandboxes the subprocess wherever a backend exists, and this only
#: decides what happens where none does. So a host that CAN sandbox is unaffected by
#: this entry, and the one behaviour it buys is the one the boundary accepts -- a task
#: that starts and serves turns on Fargate instead of refusing.
#:
#: ``sandbox`` stays ``auto`` and ``sandbox_allow_no_isolation`` stays ``False``
#: deliberately. Neither is needed for a Fargate start: ``auto`` already uses whatever
#: isolation the host offers, and the second only widens which absences are tolerated
#: quietly. A boundary that accepts one consequence does not license every loosening
#: that shares its file.
