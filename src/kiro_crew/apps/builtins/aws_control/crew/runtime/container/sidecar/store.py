"""The bucket, as the two narrowest operations the durability pair needs.

``put`` and ``get``, and nothing else. There is no ``list`` and no ``delete``, for
the same reason the front's reader has neither: a capability that exists is a
capability a later edit can reach for, and both of those change what the pair
means. A ``list`` on the restore side turns "bring back this task's own authority
files" into "enumerate the bucket", and a ``delete`` puts retention -- deciding
that a customer's history may go -- inside the process whose job is to keep it.

## Why ``put`` takes a descriptor and a size

Both halves of the consistency property live in that signature. The caller opens
the file ONCE and hands over the open descriptor, so the bytes uploaded are the
bytes that descriptor addresses, whatever later happens to the name. And the size
is the caller's, measured on the same descriptor at the same moment, so the upload
sends exactly the length that was true then.

Together they make a coherent copy without a lock and without a staged duplicate:

* The backend publishes a transcript with a temporary file and a rename, so it
  never writes into the bytes behind an open descriptor -- it swaps the directory
  entry to a different inode. A descriptor opened before the swap therefore keeps
  addressing a whole, finished version.
* A file that is instead appended to grows behind the descriptor. Sending exactly
  the recorded length uploads the prefix that existed at open time, which is a
  version that was really on disk. The next cycle sees a newer size and sends the
  longer one.

Neither case copies the file first, so there is nothing to bound: the upload spends
one descriptor and one fixed buffer, not a second copy of the data.

## What is NOT here

Absence, permanence and the read ceiling. Those are in ``common/objects.py``, shared
with the front's reader, because the first version kept a copy in each process and the
copies disagreed about a missing bucket within one revision. This module is the two
requests and nothing else.

        ``ContentLength`` is passed explicitly and the body is wrapped, so the length
        declared to S3 and the length actually sent are the same number and both are
        the one the caller measured. Without the wrapper a file that grew during the
        upload would send more bytes than the header promised; without the header the
        transport would buffer to find the length, which is the staged copy this
        design exists to avoid.

        *budget* is seconds this whole REQUEST may take, and the body is given the part of it
        that the body can enforce. The client's ``connect_timeout`` and ``read_timeout`` bound
        a single connect and a single read; a connection delivering small chunks under the read
        timeout trips neither however long the object takes, so without this the only thing
        that ends a slow upload is the drain window's SIGKILL -- which arrives in the middle of
        a PUT, losing that object and saying nothing about the ones after it. With it the
        upload is cut while it is still progressing and the caller records exactly what did
        not go.

        The body's share is the budget less one request timeout, because after the body is
        drained the transport waits for the RESPONSE and never asks the body again. Handing the
        body the whole budget would let the request spend that wait on top of it, so the gate
        would reserve one number and the PUT would spend it plus a timeout -- the overrun the
        reservation exists to make impossible.

        *cancel* is what bounds the upload a caller deliberately gave no budget. Asked
        between chunks by the same body, so a stop arriving mid-transmission ends the
        request instead of being noticed after it: the caller whose next act is to hand a
        shorter window to a more important cycle cannot wait out an upload that has no
        window at all.

        A permanent failure -- a denial, a bucket that is not there -- is raised as
        :class:`StoreUnusable` rather than as itself, so the caller is not handed a
        fault its retry can never resolve. Neither cut is permanent: the bucket answered
        and the transport worked, so each leaves as its own :class:`UploadCut` and the
        next cycle attempts the object again.
