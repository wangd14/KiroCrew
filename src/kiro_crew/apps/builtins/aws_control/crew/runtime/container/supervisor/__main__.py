"""Container entrypoint: order the task, supervise it, drain it on shutdown.

Run as ``python -m container.supervisor``. This is the task's init process. It
does not serve anything itself; it enforces the startup order the contract makes
a correctness requirement and then supervises the children.

The order (``docs/system-specs/modules/aws-control.md``, "Four processes, one task"):

1. Gate the environment (layout, model credential, sandbox) and install the crew
   bundle. Nothing has started.
2. The authority files are restored to completion. This is before the backend on
   purpose: the backend flushes the slot table from its own memory, so a backend
   that starts first persists an empty one over the restored files.
3. The backend starts and ``wait_until_ready`` returns (port answers AND the
   boot secret exists).
4. The front process starts, and then the sidecar, whose first cycle copies what
   the backend has written.

A task with no bucket configured has no durability: steps 2 and the sidecar are
both no-ops, the front says so once at startup, and the task serves turns.

Shutdown drains process groups, not pids (see ``process.py``): a ``kiro-cli``
worker is a two-process tree and signalling only the launcher orphans a child
that finishes its turn. Teardown order is front, then backend, then sidecar: stop
new turns arriving first, then let the backend drain in-flight work and flush to
disk, and the sidecar LAST because its final cycle has to see the bytes that
flush produced. Anything still alive after the backend is gone is an escaped
worker it could not reap, so the teardown sweeps orphaned process groups directly.

Track boundaries: the front ``__main__`` seam is imported by its documented path,
lazily, so this module stays importable and testable and never reimplements the
other track's work.

    The supervisor is PID 1 in this image (``CMD ["python", "-m", "container.supervisor"]``),

    ESCAPED worker findable at all: a kiro-cli worker calls ``start_new_session``, so it is in
    its own process group and no ``killpg`` of the backend's group can reach it -- but when the
    backend dies, the worker becomes our child.

    Read from ``/proc`` rather than tracked, because the supervisor never learns the pid: the
    backend spawns its workers and tells nobody. Linux-only, which ``crew/runtime/**`` already
    is; a missing ``/proc`` yields an empty list rather than an error, so a host without it
    degrades to the previous behaviour instead of failing the shutdown.

    A child in OUR OWN process group is NOT one of these, and is excluded here rather than in
    the caller. The subject is a process whose REAPER is gone; a process sharing our group
    still has us, and the caller's remedy is a group signal, which on our own group SIGKILLs
    this process -- so the sweep's remaining rounds never run and every real orphan is left
    alive. One such child is enough, and it is a reachable shape rather than a theoretical
    one: a library this process uses can hold a pool of helper children (the sensitive-path
    resolver keeps several), and those sit in our group. Nothing the sweep exists to reach is
    lost, because every one of those is in a group of its own -- an escaped worker by
    ``start_new_session``, the front and backend by being spawned into theirs -- and a
    same-group child dies with us when this process exits, which is the next thing to happen.

    The group comes from the SAME ``/proc`` line the parent does (``pgrp`` is the field after

def export_kiro_home(settings: Settings) -> Path:
    """Point this task's kiro home at ``<data home>/kiro``. Returns the agents dir.

    Exported into THIS process's environment, not just handed to the backend, because
    the bundle installer resolves the agents directory from ``os.environ``
    (``bundle.default_kiro_agents_dir``, which mirrors kiro-cli's own
    ``$KIRO_HOME``-or-``~/.kiro`` rule and imports no ``kiro_crew``). One export is
    therefore what makes the installer and the backend agree on one directory; the
    backend additionally gets the value from ``settings`` (``build_backend_env``), so
    neither side depends on the other having run first.

    WHY the default is wrong here, which is the whole reason this exists. With no
    ``KIRO_HOME`` the agents directory is the process HOME's ``~/.kiro/agents``, which
    every instance under that ``$HOME`` shares. The backend runs on a non-default data
    home (``KIROCREW_HOME=<data home>``) and Kiro Crew REFUSES to rewrite a shared
    agents dir from one: the specs it writes pin the writer's data home into every
    managed MCP server entry, which fails strict session identity for a default-home
    gateway (kirodotdev/KiroCrew#9690). Measured consequence in the container: the
    supervisor's crew spec landed in the shared dir with no ownership provenance, the
    backend read it as another home's, declined to write, and every turn died with
    ``DerivedSpecStale: the default agent spec .../kirocrew.json is missing``.

    ``<data home>/kiro`` is that guard's own documented private-target case (see
    ``Settings.kiro_home``), so this fixes the refusal by giving the task a directory
    it owns -- NOT by relaxing the guard, which protects a real poisoning bug.

    Fails CLOSED on four things, because every one of them is silent otherwise:

    * A SYMLINK at either path this function owns. The privacy exemption is decided on
      RESOLVED paths on both sides, so a link at ``<data home>/kiro`` or at its
      ``agents`` child pointing into the shared tree makes the shared directory itself
      test as "provably private" -- and the backend then rewrites the specs the guard
      exists to protect, which is worse than the failure this function fixes. The
      reachable planter is a previous task's model worker: it runs unsandboxed under
      this uid with the volume writable, so a link it leaves behind survives into the
      next boot. Refused with ``is_symlink``, which does NOT follow, and refused BEFORE
      the export so a poisoned layout never reaches the backend's environment.
    * A path that resolves outside ``<data home>/kiro/agents``. The check above reads the
      path and the ``mkdir`` below uses it, so a link appearing in that window is
      followed rather than refused; this closes the window by stating the guard's own
      equation on what actually landed. The guard compares
      ``resolve(<kiro home>/agents)`` against ``resolve(<data home>)/kiro/agents``, so an
      equality here means the exemption the backend will take is genuine rather than

    """Refuse to start unless the model subprocess can run sandboxed, or the
    deployment declares the internal-only trust boundary.

    kiro-cli runs the model subprocess inside a sandbox. On Linux that needs an
    unprivileged user namespace; without one, ``wrap_argv`` fails CLOSED. This
    container is sandboxed-only by default, so a host that cannot provide one is
    refused here, loudly, rather than left to fail every turn.

    **Why taking the credential out of the worker's environment does not earn an
    unsandboxed posture.** The worker auto-approves every tool it calls on untrusted
    prompt content, so what matters is whether it can REACH a credential -- not whether
    one is resident in its own environment. ``build_backend_env`` closes the
    environment route, and this function asserts that below. The route it cannot close
    is the vault: the backend answers the engine's token request from it, so the
    backend's uid must be able to decrypt it, and the worker is a child of the backend
    under that same uid. Measured -- a uid-1000 process reads and decrypts that vault
    directly. So no clean environment can be traded for this refusal, and the
    assertion below is a tripwire on that invariant rather than a posture.

    **What CAN lift it is a trust boundary, not a credential claim.** With
    ``settings.internal_only`` the deployment states that this task runs the operator's
    OWN crews and that the operator bears the risk of what those crews read. The
    exposure is then ACCEPTED, and it is worth being exact about its size: it is NOT
    only a prompt an outsider types. An internal crew consumes untrusted CONTENT as a
    matter of course -- tool output, fetched web pages, connector and API payloads,
    repository and ticket text -- any of which can carry an injection, and all of which
    reach the worker whoever sent the prompt. So with this set, a worker injected
    through any of those routes can read the vault. What the claim buys is not "no
    injection can happen" but "the credential at risk and the account it belongs to are
    the operator's own". That is why the switch names the boundary and not the
    consequence -- an operator cannot set "allow unsandboxed" without saying whose crews
    these are and therefore who bears it. Closing the route properly still needs a user
    namespace, a worker under a different uid from the BACKEND (the gateway's own spawn
    path), or a credential not worth stealing; a Firecracker-based runtime is the answer
    for multi-tenant or external callers.

    **Only ``SANDBOX_AVAILABLE`` proceeds unconditionally, and only ``SANDBOX_DENIED``
    is lift-able.** Undetermined refuses whatever the boundary says, and so does any
    verdict this function does not recognise. Reading a probe that cannot reach an
    answer as permission to continue is the same defect as reading the environment
    through a denylist: it holds for the hosts someone already thought of and fails
    open on the next one. A boundary can accept a KNOWN exposure and cannot accept an
    unknown one. The refusal repeats the verdict verbatim so an operator learns what
    could not be determined rather than only that something could not be.
