"""One spelling of "fetch an object, with a ceiling, and classify what came back".

Both processes talk to the same bucket for opposite reasons: the sidecar PUTs this
task's state, the front GETs the one transcript a turn continues. Each needs the same
three judgements, and they are here rather than in each process because the first
version kept a copy in both and the copies drifted immediately -- one classified a
missing BUCKET as a missing OBJECT and the other classified it as a failure, so the
same bucket typo produced a refused turn in one process and an empty conversation list
in the other. Neither copy was wrong about itself, which is why no test caught it.

The three judgements:

* **A ceiling that is enforced while reading**, not after. A single ``read()``
  materialises whatever the object happens to be, so a check afterwards is a check on
  memory already spent. Reading one chunk PAST the limit is what makes the refusal
  decidable, since stopping exactly at the limit cannot tell an object of that size
  from a larger one.
* **Absence**, which is the only answer that may be read as "there is nothing here".
  A denial is not absence. On a crew's first task the objects are genuinely not there
  yet, and that has to be distinguishable from a read that failed, because one of the
  two is allowed to continue and the other is not.
* **Permanence**, which decides whether a retry is worth anything. A throttle resolves
  itself; a denied request against a bucket that does not exist does not. Retrying the
  second one turns a broken backup into a log line while the task keeps taking turns
  nothing will save.

    leave it for the next cycle. The bucket answered and the transport worked in each
    case, so neither is a :class:`StoreUnusable` and neither may be classified permanent
    -- doing that would end the process over a slow network or an ordinary shutdown.

class UploadDeadlineExceeded(UploadCut):
    """The whole request outlived the time its caller set aside for it.

    Raised from the BODY rather than by a check around the request, because the thing
    that needs bounding is the transmission itself. Socket timeouts bound one read or
    one connect; a connection that keeps delivering small chunks under that bound never
    trips either, so the sum across a large object is unbounded. The transport asks the
    body for the next chunk many times during a send, which makes that the one place a
    request can be cut off while it is progressing.

    Not a :class:`StoreUnusable`: the bucket answered and the transport worked. The
    object simply did not fit the window, so the caller records it as this cycle's
    refusal and the next cycle attempts it again.
    """


class UploadCancelled(UploadCut):
    """A stop arrived while this upload was in flight, so the body cut it.

    The deadline above cannot cover this. An interval cycle is deliberately given no
    window -- it has a next cycle to finish a slow object, so bounding it would refuse a
    large transcript forever -- and that is exactly the upload a SIGTERM can land in the
    middle of. Its cycle must return before the final one can begin, and the final cycle's
    deadline is measured from when the stop was OBSERVED, so every second an in-flight
    interval PUT keeps running is a second taken from the window that uploads the turns
    the backend just flushed. Cutting it costs an object the final cycle was going to send
    anyway; not cutting it costs the turns that only the final cycle has.

    Checked in the body for the same reason the deadline is: between objects is too coarse
    when one object's transmission is the thing that outlives the signal.
    """


class BoundedReader:
    """A read-only view of *fh* that stops after *limit* bytes, and can be rewound.

    The bound belongs to the CALLER rather than to the transport because it is a
    property of the snapshot: *limit* is the length the descriptor's file had when it
    was opened, so stopping there is what makes an appended file's upload a coherent
    prefix instead of a race with its writer. Letting the transport read to end-of-file
    would send however much had arrived by the time it got there, which is a length
    nothing observed.

    Rewinding is offered because the transport needs it and the bound survives it. A
    retryable S3 failure makes botocore seek the body back to its start before sending
    again, so a body that refuses to seek turns every transient error into a lost object
    -- and on the final cycle there is no next interval to correct it. Seeking here moves
    the DESCRIPTOR back to where this view began and restores the remaining budget, so a
    retry re-sends exactly the same prefix rather than a longer one the file has grown
    into. Offsets are relative to the view, so nothing outside ``[0, limit]`` is
    reachable through it.

    *deadline* is an optional ``time.monotonic`` reading after which a read raises
    :class:`UploadDeadlineExceeded` instead of returning bytes. It bounds the WHOLE
    transmission, so a rewind does not refresh it: the caller set that much time aside
    for getting this object into the bucket, and the retries are part of getting it
    there. A reader built without one is an unbounded body, which is what an interval
    cycle wants -- it has no window to overrun and a next cycle to correct it, so cutting
    a slow-but-progressing upload there abandons an object that was on its way instead of
    saving anything.

    *cancel* is the other half of that, and the reason an unbounded body is still safe. It
    is a predicate asked before each chunk; once it answers True the read raises
    :class:`UploadCancelled`. An interval cycle passes the stop flag, so the upload it has
    no reason to bound by TIME is still cut the moment there is a reason to stop it at all
    -- which is what lets the cycle return and the final cycle begin inside the window the
    supervisor is counting. A rewind does not clear it either: the predicate is re-asked on
    every read rather than latched, so a transport retrying the body meets the same stop.

    The two are complementary by design and not both set in practice: the final cycle has
    the deadline and no stop to honour (the flag is what made it final), an interval cycle
    has the stop and no window.
