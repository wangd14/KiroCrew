"""Environment contract for the three container processes.

Every process in the task reads its configuration from here and nowhere else.
Parsing happens once, at import of `load()`, and the result is frozen: a process
that disagrees with another about a path or a port is the failure mode this
module exists to prevent.

`SMC_` is a historical prefix. It stands for an earlier project name and says
nothing about what this deployment is: a task belongs to the owner who launched
it, one principal reaches it, and there is no sharing surface, no second caller
and no guest. `SMC_SINGLE_PRINCIPAL` below is what the container refuses to boot
without, and it is the opposite of a sharing switch -- it is the deployment
vouching that only one principal can reach the task. Renaming the prefix would
touch the image, the task definition and every test that constructs an
environment, so the names stay and this paragraph is the correction.

`SMC_INTERNAL_ONLY` is the second declaration of that kind and the only one that
LOOSENS anything: it is the deployment vouching that this task runs the operator's
OWN crews and that the operator bears the risk of what those crews read, which is
what makes an unsandboxed model subprocess acceptable on a host that cannot sandbox
one. It does NOT claim that no untrusted input arrives -- see the field below for the
exposure it accepts. Both default to "not claimed", because a claim is what unlocks a
posture and silence must never.

Two values are deliberately NOT configurable.

`BACKEND_HOST` is fixed at 127.0.0.1. The Kiro Crew backend must never be
reachable from the network, and a setting is a thing an operator can get wrong.

The backend's authentication secret is not here either. It is generated per boot
and is read from disk on every use; see `secret.py`.

#: Ceiling on an object this task will read from the bucket into memory, or warn about
#: sending to it.
#:
#: Pinned here because every process that moves an object reads it, and a second copy is
#: the drift the shared key module exists to prevent in the other direction. The front
#: holds a fetched transcript IN MEMORY for the length of a turn and the restore step holds
#: an authority file long enough to validate and write it, so without a ceiling one object
#: decides how much memory the task uses. The sidecar reads the same number to say so at
#: upload time, when an operator can still act, rather than leaving a customer's turn to
#: discover it.
#:
#: 64 MiB is far above any real transcript or slot index (both are JSON text) and far below
#: the task's memory, so it separates "a big conversation" from "an object that should not
#: be read at all" without needing to know which conversations exist.
MAX_OBJECT_BYTES: int = 64 * 1024 * 1024

#: How long one bucket request may take, and how many attempts it gets.
#:
#: Declared here because the supervisor's sidecar drain window is sized against them:
#: the final cycle has to finish inside that window, so one hung connection must not be
#: able to consume it. boto3's own defaults are minutes long with more retries, which is
#: the right posture for a long-running client and the wrong one for a process that is
#: being drained.
#:
#: The timeout is spent TWICE per attempt, because it bounds the connect and the read
#: separately. The count is a count of ATTEMPTS including the first, which is what the
#: client's ``total_max_attempts`` key means; its ``max_attempts`` key counts RETRIES and
#: botocore adds one to it, so passing this constant there would buy an attempt the budget
#: below does not reserve.
#:
#: One attempt, so that a whole PUT is one attempt and the final cycle's per-object budget
#: below can bound it. Retrying inside the drain window cannot help. At four attempts one
#: object's budget is 47s -- four connect-plus-read pairs at this timeout, plus standard-mode
#: backoff of ``2 ** (attempts - 1) - 1`` between them -- which is most of
#: ``SIDECAR_DRAIN_SECS`` on its own, and that window has to cover the un-budgeted pointer
#: read and the authority reservation as well. So one transcript would spend the whole window
#: and the authority objects could not publish at all. Written against the constant rather
#: than against a figure, because a window that moves leaves a worked example describing a
#: different one. The retry an interval cycle wants is the next interval cycle, which
#: re-reads the same files and republishes whatever this one recorded as failed; the final
#: cycle has no next cycle, and that is exactly the window that cannot afford one.
BACKUP_REQUEST_TIMEOUT_SECS: int = 5
BACKUP_MAX_ATTEMPTS: int = 1

#: How long each child gets to drain at teardown, and the stop timeout their sum requires.
#:
#: Declared here rather than in the supervisor because the sum is ONE CONTRACT SPLIT ACROSS
#: TWO SUBSYSTEMS. The supervisor spends these windows in order; the task definition the
#: control plane registers must give the task at least their sum, or the platform SIGKILLs
#: the supervisor mid-drain. Both read this module, so neither can move without the other.
#:
#: The front goes first, to stop new turns arriving. The backend gets the longest of the
#: three because a ``kiro-cli`` worker setsid's into its own process group, so only the
#: backend's own SIGTERM handler can reap it and a shorter window orphans workers that go
#: on to finish their turn. The sidecar goes last, and its window is for ONE cycle that
#: begins AFTER it is signalled -- the objects the backend's drain just produced, not a
#: full pass, since everything earlier is already recorded uploaded.
#:
#: That window is sized against the transport rather than guessed, and against EVERY step
#: the cycle spends rather than the uploads alone. The cycle reads the generation pointer
#: before it accounts for anything, and that ``GetObject`` carries no budget -- its bound is
#: the client's connect and read timeouts, so it can legitimately spend
#: ``BACKUP_ATTEMPT_COST_SECS`` and still succeed. Then the authority phase is reserved out
#: of the window (one attempt per authority file plus the pointer), and only what is left
#: admits a data PUT, which the gate will not start without ``BACKUP_PER_OBJECT_BUDGET_SECS``
#: remaining. So the window must hold the pointer read, the authority reservation, and one
#: worst-case data PUT; sized to the uploads alone, an ordinary slow pointer read is
#: subtracted from the data phase's admission and the drain cycle attempts NOTHING while
#: most of the window goes unused. ``test_the_drain_window_covers_every_step_the_final_cycle_spends``
#: pins the arithmetic, so a window or a cost that moves without the other reds.
#:
#: A cut final cycle still costs at most the turns since the last interval, and the objects
#: it did upload stay durable, so the worst case is bounded and loud rather than total --
#: but it is a worst case, not the planned window. Fargate caps ``stopTimeout`` at 120s,
#: which the sum has to stay under.
FRONT_DRAIN_SECS: float = 5.0
BACKEND_DRAIN_SECS: float = 25.0
SIDECAR_DRAIN_SECS: float = 60.0
#: What one ATTEMPT can cost on the wire: a connect and a read, each bounded by the request
#: timeout.
#:
#: Two timeouts, not one. ``connect_timeout`` and ``read_timeout`` are separate bounds on
#: separate phases of the same attempt, so an attempt that hangs on the connect and then
#: again on the read spends both. The authority files are sub-kilobyte JSON whose body is one
#: read, so this is what a whole index PUT can cost and what its reservation uses. A DATA PUT
#: can also spend a response wait after a long transmission, which
#: ``BACKUP_PER_OBJECT_BUDGET_SECS`` adds below.
BACKUP_ATTEMPT_COST_SECS: float = 2 * BACKUP_REQUEST_TIMEOUT_SECS
#: What one object can cost the final cycle: every attempt it may make, plus the waits
#: between them.
#:
#: DERIVED from the client's own configuration rather than written as a number, so the gate
#: cannot promise a bound the transport does not honour. Standard-mode backoff is
#: exponential from a one-second base, so the wait before attempt n is ``2 ** (n - 2)`` and
#: the waits across ``attempts`` attempts total ``2 ** (attempts - 1) - 1``.
#:
#: ENFORCED, not merely budgeted. The socket timeouts above bound one connect and one read,
#: which is not a bound on a request: a connection handing over small chunks inside the read
#: timeout never trips it, so the time to send a large object is unbounded however tight
#: those numbers are. The cycle therefore hands this number to the store as the window for
#: the object, and the body stops the transmission when it passes -- so what the gate
#: reserves and what a PUT may spend are the same number rather than two numbers that agree
#: only when the network is fast.
#:
#: The final cycle uploads sequentially, so its total is this times the number of changed
#: objects, which nothing bounds. The cycle therefore carries a DEADLINE and stops
#: attempting objects it cannot finish inside the drain window, naming each one it did not
#: reach. Between the two, an overrun is a short cycle that reports exactly what is missing
#: and exits non-zero, rather than a SIGKILL in the middle of a PUT -- which loses the object
#: being sent and says nothing about the rest.
#:
#: An INTERVAL cycle passes no window. It has none to protect and a next cycle to finish the
#: object, so bounding a slow upload there abandons one that was on its way; an object too
#: slow for this window is uploaded across intervals and only refused on the final cycle,
#: where the alternative is losing it silently.
#:
#: The response wait is part of it, and is the one part a body-enforced deadline cannot reach.
#: The transmission stops when the body refuses its next chunk, but once the body is DRAINED
#: the transport is waiting for the response and nothing in the body is consulted again. That
#: wait is bounded only by ``read_timeout``, so a PUT can finish transmitting exactly on its
#: allowance and still spend one more timeout before the call returns. So the number reserved
#: here is the whole request, and ``BACKUP_TRANSMISSION_BUDGET_SECS`` below is the smaller
#: share the store hands the body -- reserving one number and spending it plus a timeout is
#: how a gate that admitted an upload still meets the SIGKILL mid-request.
BACKUP_PER_OBJECT_BUDGET_SECS: float = (
    BACKUP_MAX_ATTEMPTS * BACKUP_ATTEMPT_COST_SECS

    + BACKUP_REQUEST_TIMEOUT_SECS

#: What the BODY may spend, which is the reservation above less the response wait it cannot

    task in its first wait, and the supervisor treats a lifetime stop as an
    ORDERLY one, so a task that did no work at all would report a clean shutdown.
    The launcher derives this value and the request builder refuses a caller who
    names it, so a negative arriving here says the launcher is wrong rather than
    that an operator mistyped, and a refusal at startup is how that gets seen.

    control and is refused without the control secret. It cannot strip a control
    route into the customer surface, because the only way to reach the turn path
    after stripping is to have sent the turn path.
