"""Putting ONE conversation's transcript on disk, at the turn that needs it.

Boot downloads no transcripts at all: a task starts with the two authority files
and no conversations. This module is the other half of that change. Before a
turn reaches the backend, the one transcript that turn continues is fetched.

The property the pair achieves, stated exactly: *a task only ever holds the
conversations it itself served, and loses them when it exits.*

Each rule below is a way this goes wrong silently, so each is enforced by
construction rather than by review.

* **One object, never a list.** The reader this module talks to has no ``list``
  and no ``put`` (:class:`TranscriptReader`), so listing the prefix is not a
  thing this code path can do. A single list would undo the whole change at the
  first turn.
* **Absent is NORMAL.** A new conversation has no transcript yet, and its first
  turn must proceed.
* **Already on disk means this task already served it.** Do not re-fetch and do
  not overwrite: the local copy is newer than S3 by up to one backup interval,
  so overwriting rolls a customer's conversation backwards. The write uses
  ``os.link`` onto the target, which FAILS if the target exists, so
  "never overwrite" is a filesystem guarantee and not a check that a later edit
  can quietly drop.
* **A fetch that fails FAILS THE TURN.** A customer whose conversation appears
  forgotten is worse than an error, and the damage is worse than it first looks:
  the backend would create a fresh transcript holding only this turn, and the
  sidecar replaces whole objects, so the next backup cycle would overwrite the
  customer's entire history in S3. Failing the turn is what holds that hazard
  closed. The failure is :class:`TranscriptUnavailable`, surfaced with its own
  error code.
* **Never log a transcript's contents.** The sid and the byte count only.

**The filename, which is the part that was found the hard way.** The object is
``<thread>_<slot>.jsonl``, not ``<slot>.jsonl``, and for this deployment the
thread is always ``dashboard``. Verified in the Kiro Crew wheel this image ships
(``vendor/kirocrew-0.6.0-py3-none-any.whl``):

* ``dashboard/openai_compat.py:257`` takes the turn's ``id`` as the slot id and
  ``:296`` resolves it through ``state.get_or_create_slot``, which normalizes
  with ``dashboard/state.py:_normalize_slot_key``.
* That function's docstring states the invariant a restart depends on:
  ``_safe_key(_history_key_for(key)) == f"dashboard_{key}"``. So the transcript
  stem is the slot key with a ``dashboard_`` prefix, and the file is
  ``<sessions_dir>/dashboard_<slot>.jsonl``.
* ``control/observe.py resolve_open_slots`` documents the same mapping from the
  other side, plus the verbatim form (``weixin_...``) that belongs to a
  channel-born conversation. No channel credentials are supplied to this
  container (``docs/system-specs/modules/aws-control.md``), so every conversation here is a
  dashboard slot and the thread is not ambiguous.

``_normalize_slot_key`` is mirrored rather than imported: the wheel is a vendored
artifact the front process does not import from, and the mapping is three lines.
:func:`transcript_stem` is pinned against the values in those two sources by
``tests/test_front_transcript_fetch.py``.

Archived segments (``sessions/archive/**``) are deliberately NOT fetched: finding
them requires listing, which is the one thing this path may not do. Rotation
keeps the recent window in the live transcript, so a turn continues from the live
object; older segments stay in S3 and remain readable by the owner's control
plane, which has credentials of its own.

    The two transports differ in WHERE they enter this scope, not in what it
    does: the non-streamed turn enters it in the request handler, and the
    streamed turn enters it inside its generator, because an SSE response must
    keep the slot for the life of the stream. Both enter the same object, so the
    fetch happens inside the per-slot lock on both paths and the ordering exists
    in one place. Writing the fetch into each transport instead would leave two
    copies of "before the body reaches the backend" to keep in agreement.
    Both the lock and the fetch are keyed on the CANONICAL slot, not the string
    the caller sent. ``cust-1``, ``dashboard_cust-1`` and ``dashboard:cust-1`` all
    name one conversation and resolve to one transcript, so locking on the raw id
    would hand two spellings two different locks and let them run at once, on the
    same file, while the serializer reported one turn per slot.
