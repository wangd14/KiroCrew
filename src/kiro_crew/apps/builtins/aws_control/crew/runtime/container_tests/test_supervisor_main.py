"""Tests for ``container.supervisor.__main__`` -- the startup ORDER and the drained
teardown order.

The supervisor gates the environment, installs the bundle, restores the authority files,
starts the backend, waits for readiness, starts the front, starts the backup sidecar, and
drains front, backend then sidecar at teardown. The seams are stubbed; the point here is the
ordering guarantees, proven by the recorded call sequence.
