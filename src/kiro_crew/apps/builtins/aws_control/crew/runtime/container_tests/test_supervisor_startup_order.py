"""The order the supervisor starts and drains its children in.

Two orderings here are correctness rules, not preferences, and neither is visible in the
output of the thing it protects:

* The authority files are restored to COMPLETION before the backend starts. The backend
  flushes the slot table from its own memory, so a backend that starts first persists an
  empty one over the restored files. The conversation list then comes up blank while the
  transcripts are still in the bucket, and nothing reports a fault.
* The sidecar is drained LAST. Its final cycle uploads what the backend's own drain
  flushed, so draining it earlier loses every turn taken since the previous interval on
  an orderly replacement, which is the common case because a deploy is one.
* That final cycle's verdict reaches the EXIT CODE. It is the only copy of the turns in
  the backend's flush, so a task that is asked to stop, fails the cycle and still exits
  0 reports a lossless replacement for a lossy one.

Both are pinned on the recorded SEQUENCE of calls. A test that only checked each step
happened would pass on either ordering, which is the failure being guarded against.

The orphan sweep is stubbed wherever the real ``_teardown`` is called. It discovers and
kills process groups on the host it runs on, and a test has no business doing that.
