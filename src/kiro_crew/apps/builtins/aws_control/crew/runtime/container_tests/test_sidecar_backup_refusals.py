"""What the writer does with an entry it cannot simply upload.

The contract this subsystem is held to has one rule above the others: nothing in the
backup set is skipped quietly. So every branch that could end in "this object was not
uploaded" is pinned here, and each is pinned on the OBSERVABLE the operator gets --
the cycle result, and whether the cycle raises -- rather than on a log line.

The set splits three ways and the difference matters:

* **Too large.** Uploaded anyway. The restore side will refuse to read it, so the pair
  is incomplete for that one conversation, and the cycle says so.
* **Not a file whose bytes can be uploaded.** Refused, and the cycle raises. A link or
  a FIFO where a transcript belongs is not a transcript.
* **Gone.** Not a failure. An entry listed and then removed is a conversation its owner
  deleted between the two steps.
