"""Reach the container package the way the image does: by its build context.

The subject of this suite is imported as top-level ``container.*``, because that
is what it is inside the image -- ``/app`` is on ``sys.path`` and the package
sits at ``/app/container``. Modules import ``container.common`` absolutely, so
that name is part of the image's contract rather than an artifact of where the
source sits in the image. Rewriting the imports to this repository's package
path would break the image at runtime.

``crew/runtime/`` therefore has no ``__init__.py``: it is a docker build
context, not a python package, and
``test_spawn_audit.py::test_container_image_assets_are_not_imported`` pins that
so the gateway can never import this tree by package path. Putting the build
context on ``sys.path`` here is what lets the tests resolve ``container`` while
that stays true.

pytest's prepend import mode happens to insert this same directory (it is the
first ancestor without an ``__init__.py``), so this file is belt and braces --
but the import root is a fact about the image, not about a pytest setting, and
it should be stated somewhere that survives a change to either.

# The bound is derived, not chosen: the smallest module here contributes 3 tests, so a

# raised, and the floor would start drifting again by exactly the mechanism this file
# exists to stop. Two is the largest value that still forces a floor edit in the
# commit that adds a module. ``_the_margin_is_smaller_than_the_smallest_module`` in
# the repository's ``test_ci_surface_tests`` pins that derivation against the tree, so
# widening this reddens a test rather than quietly buying more drift.
_FLOOR_MARGIN = 2

# Floor on how many tests the suite must yield, checked only under _REQUIRED_ENV.
#
# This IS the measured collection (660 items), not the measurement less a cushion.
# The position matters as much as the number, because the two directions want their
# slack on opposite sides: a test DISAPPEARING is the failure this guard exists to
# catch, so it gets no tolerance at all, while a test being ADDED is ordinary work
# that should not red a lane for the first two before anyone edits a constant. Setting
# the floor to collection-less-margin inverts both -- it spends the whole margin on
# hiding losses and leaves growth no room whatsoever.
#
# So a loss is caught the moment it takes the collection BELOW this number, and the
# blind spot is exactly the legal growth currently sitting above it: zero right after
# this constant is set to a fresh measurement, at most _FLOOR_MARGIN just before a
# raise is forced. It is never a fixed allowance, which is why it is stated as a
# relationship here and nowhere else -- the lane's own doc row points at this comment
# rather than restating it, because a bound spelled out twice is the drift this file
# exists to stop.
#
# The per-module check below catches a module that stops being collected at all and
# the per-test check catches a named test that stops yielding an item, both exact and
# holding no number; this catches the one shape neither can see, a test whose own
# parametrize cases drain away while the function is still collected under its own
# name.
#
# Growth reaches here from source as well as from tests: test_review_findings
# parametrizes over the production AWS_CRED_ENV list, so adding one credential name
# to the supervisor backend grows this collection without touching a test file.
#
# When the suite grows past the margin, raise this to the new collection, in the same
# commit as the growth: a floor left behind by a growing suite stops measuring anything
# long before anyone notices it drifted. It may be LOWERED only alongside a deliberate
# deletion of tests, in the same commit, and never to make a red lane green: a floor
# edited down to meet the measurement measures nothing.

# Not collected off Linux. This suite's SUBJECT is the source of a Linux container
# image, built by the deploy driver and run on Fargate -- not part of the application
# that installs on a user's machine. It depends on LINUX primitives that are not
# incidental: publication links a still-open descriptor through ``/proc/self/fd``, the
# supervisor forks and signals a process group, and the layout tests assert container
# filesystem paths. Linux rather than POSIX is the honest line, because macOS is POSIX
# and has no ``/proc``: a POSIX gate admits it and every test reaching publication then
# fails on a path that platform does not have. Running the suite anywhere but Linux
# measures nothing about the only platform the image runs on.
#
# Marking individual tests was tried first and is the wrong shape: the platform
# dependencies are spread across the suite, so the list was already incomplete and
# the next test to touch a fork, signal or descriptor path would redden a foreign
# platform again without changing anything real. Declining the whole tree off Linux is
# the honest unit.
#
# The suite is ALSO not collected when the image's own runtime dependencies are not
# importable. ``container/requirements.txt`` (fastapi, uvicorn, httpx, boto3) is
# marked "Container runtime only. These must NOT become dependencies of the Kiro
# Crew app itself" -- the app's backend hooks are imported into every owner's
# gateway process, and a web framework there buys nothing. So the application's own
# CI environment installs ``-e .[voice,desktop] --group dev`` and does NOT carry
# these, yet ``testpaths`` in ``setup.cfg`` walks ``src/kiro_crew/apps/builtins``
# and reaches this tree: four modules ``import httpx`` (the front's backend client)
# at module top level, which is a collection-time ``ModuleNotFoundError`` that
# cascades every backend shard. The image build context and any developer machine
# that installs ``requirements-dev.txt`` DO carry them, so the suite still runs
# where their subject can -- this only declines to run them where the deliberately
# absent deps make the subject unimportable, rather than forcing the app env to
# grow a dependency the runtime contract forbids.
#
# Only the deps imported AT MODULE TOP LEVEL by the test modules gate collection:
# ``httpx`` (four modules), ``fastapi`` and ``uvicorn`` (``test_front_proxy``).
# ``boto3`` is deliberately NOT in this list -- ``front/transcript.py`` imports it
# lazily inside a function ("keep the package importable without AWS"), so it is
# never touched at collection time and a venv without it (the app's own dev env is

    They are different failures, and only the second catches a module that quietly
    stops yielding tests while every dependency is still importable.

    Four checks, and the first two cannot rot: what must yield tests is read off the
    filesystem, so it needs no maintenance and cannot disagree with the tree. A module
    that defines tests and contributed no collected item is an error whatever the
    reason, and so is a single named test that the source declares and the collection
    does not hold -- the shape a decorator swallowing its function makes, or an import
    guard that turns a class into nothing. Deleting a test legitimately removes it
    from both sides and stays silent, which is why these checks can be exact rather
    than a floor.

    The count floor then covers the one shape reading names cannot see: a test whose
    own cases drain away while its name is still collected. A floor is a remembered
    number, so the last check keeps it honest in the other direction -- a collection
    running far above the floor means the suite grew and the floor was left behind,
