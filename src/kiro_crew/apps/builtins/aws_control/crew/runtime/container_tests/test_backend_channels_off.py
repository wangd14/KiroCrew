"""The container serves no messaging channel, and says so positively.

A crew in a container has nobody to reach on Slack or Telegram: the only caller it
serves is the customer's HTTP turn through the front process. A transport that comes
up hands that crew an outbound channel into an owner's workspace that nobody chose to
grant it.

Two mechanisms, because neither alone is complete. The config file turns every
transport off by name, which is the only thing that reaches ``imessage`` and
``whatsapp`` -- their registry descriptors carry no credential at all, so they start
on their config flag. The credential strip is what reaches ``slack``, whose config
section has no ``enabled`` key and which starts on its tokens.
