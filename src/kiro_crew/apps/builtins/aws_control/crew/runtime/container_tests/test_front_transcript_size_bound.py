"""The transcript restore is bounded by size as well as by shape.

Every other guard on this path answers "is this entry the right KIND of thing". This one
answers "how much of it is this process willing to hold": the bytes come from the backup
bucket and live in memory for the length of a turn, so without a ceiling one stored
object decides how much memory the task uses.

Two bounds, because a header is a claim rather than a bound. `ContentLength` is checked
before a byte is read, and the streaming read enforces the same ceiling on what actually
arrives.
