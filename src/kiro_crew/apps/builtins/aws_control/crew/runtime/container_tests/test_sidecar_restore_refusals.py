"""What the restore step refuses, and why refusing is the safe direction.

The backend's own readers ignore an authority file they cannot parse and carry on with
an empty result. That is right for them and wrong here: bytes written by this step are
read once as "no conversations" and are then replaced by the backend's next flush, so a
malformed object would look like a restore that worked and leave the customer's list
empty. Refusing to boot turns that silent loss into a message an operator gets before
the task serves a turn.

Absence is the one case that is NOT a failure. A crew's first task finds nothing in the
bucket, which is a first boot. Every other reason a read does not return bytes -- a
denial above all -- is a failure, because reading a denial as absence is the route to
booting with an empty slot table and flushing it over the real one.
