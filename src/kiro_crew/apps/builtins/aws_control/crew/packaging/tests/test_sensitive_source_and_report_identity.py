    A review asked twice for descriptor-anchored traversal on Windows -- "use Windows
    no-reparse handles for every component". Three facts, each checkable:

    * ``pinned_fs.supports_pinned_walk()`` requires ``O_DIRECTORY``, ``O_NOFOLLOW`` and
      ``os.open in os.supports_dir_fd``, and returns False on Windows: there is no open,
      stat or enumeration RELATIVE to a held directory handle there, and a walk, a stat,
      an enumeration and a mutation each need exactly that (``_nofollow_primitive_available``).
    * Every caller of it in the tree branches on that predicate rather than assuming it.
    * ``eval/bench/safepath.py`` reached this exact question and settled it against a ctypes
      ``CreateFileW`` with ``FILE_FLAG_OPEN_REPARSE_POINT``, because it buys a property
      another mechanism already gives "at the price of security code that cannot be
      exercised on the machine this harness is developed on".

    What the repo HAS since gained is narrower than the request, and this test records the
    line: ``pinned_fs.real_dir_path_pinned`` resolves ONE directory on Windows through a
    root-first chain of ``platform_compat.pin_directory`` handles (``CreateFileW`` with
    ``FILE_FLAG_OPEN_REPARSE_POINT``, held without ``FILE_SHARE_DELETE``), exercised on the
    Windows CI shard for the dashboard's project-directory admission. That answers "is this
    directory, named once, really the directory" -- a single by-name open per component,
    each under ancestors already held. It does not answer what the builder asks, which is
    to ENUMERATE and COPY a tree relative to what it holds: ``os.scandir``, ``os.stat`` and
    ``os.open`` take no ``dir_fd`` on Windows, so every child of a held directory would
    still be reached by NAME, and a name is what a watcher swaps. So the Windows branch here
    still checks each component by attribute, states that a swap inside the remaining window
    wins, and refuses a redirect planted before the build ran -- which is the realistic shape.
    Pinned as a rejection so the next review pass reads the reasoning instead of re-filing
    the request, and as a confinement so the day pinned_fs grows a handle-relative WALK on
