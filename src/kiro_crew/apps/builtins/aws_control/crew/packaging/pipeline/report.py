    ``os.replace(report_tmp, report_path)`` re-resolves ``report_path`` by NAME and OVERWRITES
    whatever is there, so a concurrent process that drops a foreign file at that path between
    the caller's checks and the install would have it clobbered -- "I chose this path" is not
    "I own what is at it now". This opens the parent once with ``O_NOFOLLOW | O_DIRECTORY``,
    re-checks the leaf by ``lstat`` against that descriptor, and then installs by EXCLUSIVE
    HARD LINK (``os.link``, which fails ``FileExistsError``) rather than a replace: a file that
    arrives in the window is ANSWERED by the link failing, not assumed away, and the collision
    is REFUSED. When the path already holds this build's own verified prior report, that report
    is moved aside first and restored (or preserved beside a racer's file) so no refusal path
    is ever destructive.

    Shape is not the whole of ownership. A value read back has four independent properties, and
    each can have changed since we last saw it: whether it EXISTS, whether it is the SAME OBJECT,
    whether its CONTENT is unchanged, and whether it is READABLE. The shape ``lstat`` covers the
    first two; a concurrent process that edits the report IN PLACE leaves the same object, still
    readable, with different bytes -- missing none of the first two, so a shape check alone says
    fine while a plain overwrite would destroy that edit. The build owns the report exclusively
    for the duration of one build (it only ever writes it through ``report_tmp`` + this publish,
    never in place), so the bytes at ``report_path`` must still equal what the caller read before
    the build (``report_before``), or the file must be absent. Anything else is a foreign edit,
    and the only definitely-wrong answer is to overwrite it -- a report is not mergeable, so drift
    is REFUSED. The content is read through the SAME descriptor the publish targets, so the bytes
    compared are the bytes that would be superseded.

    platform without descriptor-relative opens there is no atomic form, and the whole builder
    already refuses on such a platform before reaching here -- but the guard is stated locally
