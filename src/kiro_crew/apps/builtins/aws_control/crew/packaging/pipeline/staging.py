    """Recursively delete ``target`` through a run-private aside, all relative to a pinned parent.

    ``shutil.rmtree(target)`` re-resolves ``target`` from its path string, so a swap of
    ``target`` OR of a PARENT component between the ownership check and the delete lands the
    recursive delete on whatever the path names then, and that delete is irreversible.
    ``resolved_parent`` is the parent resolved once at validation; this opens it by descriptor,
    walking every component ``O_NOFOLLOW`` and HOLDING the descriptor across the whole
    operation, and reaches ``target``, the private aside, and the caller's disposal destination
    as single leaves under it. A component swapped for a link since validation fails its own
    no-follow open and REFUSES here rather than being followed; a component swapped after this
    open is defeated, because every mutation goes through the held descriptor rather than
    re-resolving the name between two mutation points. Binding the ownership check and the
    delete to one held descriptor removes both windows:

    1. Create a private directory UNDER the pinned parent with ``os.mkdir(dir_fd=...)`` and mode
       ``0o700`` -- this build is the only writer of a name no other process chose, so nothing
       can pre-plant or swap it, and it cannot be relocated by a parent-name swap because it is
       created relative to the held descriptor.
    2. ``os.rename`` ``target`` into that private directory with ``src_dir_fd``/``dst_dir_fd``
       set to the pinned parent. ``rename`` acts on the entry under that descriptor, not a
       re-resolved path: a concurrent swap either loses the race (``target`` already gone) or
       moves the swapped tree into the private directory, where nothing outside can reach it.
    3. ``verify`` the MOVED tree -- the exact entry the rename captured -- reached through
       ``parent_fd`` as ``(parent_fd, moved_rel)``, never by re-resolving a path, so a parent
       swapped after the capture cannot make it inspect a decoy while the sweep deletes the
       captured inode. If it is not one this build wrote, rename it BACK ``dir_fd``-relative (a
       swapped-in tree the operator owns is returned untouched) and refuse; only a verified tree
       is disposed of.
    4. ``settle`` acts on the moved entry ``dir_fd``-relative to the pinned parent (the caller
       renames it to its destination; a purge leaves it for the sweep below). The private
       directory is then removed through the pinned parent by ``_rmtree_pinned``, which reaches
       every deleted path through a directory descriptor and refuses a redirect -- so the
       recursive delete cannot be steered outside the pinned parent, and it is the same inode
       step 3 verified.

    Best-effort at the edges: if ``target`` is already gone (step 2 raises
    ``FileNotFoundError``) there is nothing to dispose of and the private dir is removed; a
    partially-created private dir is cleaned on any failure.

    Returns ``True`` when the rename captured ``target``, ``verify`` and ``settle`` ran on it,
    and the private-dir sweep completed. Returns ``False`` in two cases: the already-gone case,
    where nothing was captured or verified (the early ``return``), and a sweep that did not
    complete. For the purge's no-op ``settle`` that sweep IS the delete, so ``False`` there means
    the captured tree is still under the ``.smc-purge-*`` aside, undeleted. The staging purge is
    the one caller that reads the return; the rename-to-destination and post-promotion callers
    ignore it, since their tree already reached its destination (or was already gone) and an
    unswept private dir is only best-effort residue for them.

    ``resolved_parent`` defaults to ``target.parent.resolve()`` for a direct caller with no
    earlier reading to pin; the transaction passes the value it resolved at validation so the
    pin reflects that moment rather than a fresh resolve at disposal time.
