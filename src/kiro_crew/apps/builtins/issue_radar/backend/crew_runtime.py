"""Crew runtime — the session a crew lives in, the brief it carries, the nudge that
drives every turn, and the zero-LLM change detector that wakes it.

Four things live here and nothing else:

1. **Session launch/attach** (:func:`ensure_crew_session`, :func:`launch_crew`).
   A crew is an app-owned dashboard slot keyed ``crew-<id>``, which is the only
   worker shape without a wall-clock ceiling shorter than one issue's lifecycle.
   ``auto_research``'s campaign worker is the working precedent for the session
   shape, including the parts that look redundant: the explicit title with
   ``_titled = True`` (the loop's messages never trigger the auto-titler), and
   re-deriving the crew's auto-approve grant from the watchdog every cycle because
   the grant is in-memory only and a gateway restart drops it. The grant itself
   follows the TASK RUNNER instead: a scoped, expiring, SEL-audited
   ``SafetyOverride`` grant (:func:`autoapprove_scope`), never the unbounded
   ``slot._trust`` flag a human clicks.

2. **Brief injection by presence check** (:func:`brief_is_present`). Not a
   schedule, not a turn counter — one rule that covers session start,
   post-compaction, gateway restart and any truncation mechanism nobody has
   written yet.

3. **Nudge composition** (:func:`compose_nudge`). A volatile snapshot the crew
   must not guess at, plus the brief's ``Never`` list compressed to ~80 words.

4. **The sweep** (:func:`sweep_repo`), driven from ``watch.py``'s poll loop — the
   only always-on loop in this app. Zero LLM, zero credits: it compares the six
   unblock signals against a stored fingerprint and wakes the owning crew when one
   moves.

Nothing here writes to the forge, and nothing here writes a work item: a change
detector that touched ``last_progress_at`` would renew the very claim TTL the
protocol measures from it. Its own state lives in ``crew-signals.json``, beside
the crews dir rather than inside it — ``crew_store.list_crews`` globs ``*.json``
there, so a state file dropped in that directory would read back as a phantom crew.

    * **The app gate.** ``revoke_crew_grants`` (app disable) clears grants and reads
      no crew record, so ``sync_trust`` would happily re-mint on a disabled app --
      the record still says unattended and live. The gate is read in the SAME hop
      as the mint (:func:`_trust_inputs`), so an app already off never mints. It is
      NOT re-read on the loop afterwards: that would parse ``installed.json`` on the
      gateway's only thread, and it is not needed -- a disable that completes during
      the hop runs ``revoke_crew_grants``, which bumps this crew's generation, and
      the generation compare below is what catches it.
    * **The record.** ``sync_trust`` is the assignment: ``unattended AND is_live``.
    * **A stop during the hop.** ``_revoke_generation[crew id]`` is sampled on the
      loop before the hop and compared on the loop after. A change means this crew
      was revoked while the worker was deciding, so whatever it minted is torn down.
      Both reads sit on the single-threaded loop with no ``await`` between them and
      the mint's completion, which is what makes the comparison sound.

    A disable that completed BEFORE the sample is the first bullet's job and needs
    no counter -- the gate itself is the record of that stop. A disable that lands
    AFTER the sample, whether during the hop or after it, is the third bullet's:
    its revoker bumps the generation and the compare sees it. One ordering slips
    between them: the disable HOOK runs before ``installed.json`` is written, so a
    reconciliation that starts after the hook's bump but before the flag write sees
    a bumped-and-sampled generation and an enabled gate. ``_disabling`` -- latched
    by the hook's revoker, released by the watchdog on re-enable -- is the record of
    that in-flight stop, and it is checked on both sides of the hop like the

    The wake proper is :func:`_wake_crew_body`; what this wrapper adds is the ONE
    exit every path out of it goes through. The auto-approve grant is minted from a
    record read before an ``await`` (``sync_trust``, off the loop), so any path that
    returns without re-checking can leave a grant the pause route had ALREADY
    revoked standing on a crew a human stopped — a resurrected grant, not merely a
    late one. Guarding each ``return`` individually does not close that: it cannot
    cover the exception path at all, and every instance found so far was a return
    nobody had listed yet.

    So the check lives in a ``finally``, where a ``return`` added anywhere in the
    body cannot bypass it: re-read the record and revoke unless it comes back
    readable AND live. ``revoke_crew_execution`` is idempotent and best-effort, so
    the paths that already revoked pay nothing and a failure here cannot turn a
    successful wake into an exception.

    The reconciliation is itself an ``await``, so a stop can complete inside it and
    the worker can then mint from a record read before the stop. That is not closed
    by ordering reads -- the mint is always last and always a suspension point -- so
    it is closed by making the revocation visible: :func:`_reconcile_trust` compares
    ``_revoke_generation`` across the hop and tears the grant down if a revocation
    ran meanwhile. A stop whose revocation lands after that comparison is not one
    this wake raced -- nothing here mints after it -- and the grant is re-checked on
    every approval rather than sampled once.

    RECONCILED THROUGH ``sync_trust``, never through a hand-written condition. The
    grant's predicate is ``unattended AND is_live`` (:func:`sync_trust`), so a guard
    that checks liveness alone is blind to half of it: turning ``unattended`` off is a
    governance downgrade the record expresses, and a crew that is still enabled walks
    straight past a liveness check. Handing the fresh record back to the function that
    mints the grant is what keeps the two in step — it is an assignment, so it revokes
    and re-establishes as the record dictates, and no copy of its predicate can drift
    from it.

    The guarantee, stated as the invariant it is: **when ``wake_crew`` returns, the
    crew's grant matches the record as the store held it after all of the wake's
    work** — so no grant survives a stop, or an ``unattended`` downgrade, that was

      clock at all; the sweep still wakes it on a signal, but it would never pick up
      new work again. Re-arming here makes "enabled" mean enabled.
    * **Revocation.** A crew that was disabled, retired or paused while its slot was
      resident keeps its trust until something takes it away. The BACKSTOP, not the
      first line: pause and retire revoke inline before they answer, and this cycle
      catches what they cannot — a record edited directly, and a restart that

    Two things keep a crew going once armed, and neither is expressed by any record
    an app-enabled flag could speak for: the crew's auto-approve grant, keyed off
    its slot, and its autonudge loop, which fires regardless of any app's enabled
    flag. Without this, a disabled Issue Radar keeps running unattended,
    auto-approved turns.

    TWO callers, and which is which matters:

    * :func:`on_app_disabled` — the FIRST LINE, awaited inside the disable request
      itself, so "stopped" is true by the time the operator's disable returns.
    * ``watch._poll_once``'s disabled branch — the BACKSTOP, for the disables this
      module can never be told about: ``kirocrew app disable`` in another process,
      an ``installed.json`` edited on disk, and a gateway restart that re-armed
      loops for an app that is off. It runs on the poll interval by nature.

    GRANTS BEFORE LOOPS, and this order is load-bearing rather than tidy. The grant
    is the thing that lets a turn act unattended, and deactivating loops is the only
    step here that awaits — so doing loops first would hand the event loop back with
    the grants still live, and an armed timer that fired in that gap would get its
    auto-approved turn from the very call that was stopping it. Reversing these two
    statements reopens the window this function exists to close.

    Reads nothing from disk: a disabled app must stay silent, and that includes not
    walking the connected-repo config on every one of its idle cycles. Idempotent,
    as the precedent in ``auto_research`` is.
