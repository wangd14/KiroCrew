"""Issue Radar — on-disk data layout.

Everything lives under ``~/.kiro/crew/apps/issue-radar/data/`` (via
``kiro_crew.apps.manager.app_data_dir``, the platform-standard app-scoped data
dir). Nothing is stored on a KiroCrew-hosted backend and no GitHub App/PAT is
used — auth is entirely delegated to the user's own ``gh`` CLI session.

Layout::

    <data_dir>/config.json                          # connected repos, no secrets
    <data_dir>/repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues-cache.json   # last-fetched open issues
    <data_dir>/repos/{owner}/{repo}/members-cache.json  # repo members (derived)

``root`` is accepted on every function (mirroring code_review_sage's
``store.py``) so tests can point at a tmp dir instead of the real app data dir.

# private instance, and a GitLab group can share a name with a GitHub owner.

# Public GitHub keeps its ORIGINAL path, which keeps the layout migration-free:
# an install that has been triaging GitHub issues keeps every cache, setting, and
# investigation note exactly where it already is, and a bug in the GitLab layout
# cannot corrupt existing data because that layout is only ever entered by a
# non-GitHub key.
#
# Everything else is rooted under a reserved segment that a GitHub owner can
# never produce: ``parse_github_repo_url`` constrains owners to
# ``[A-Za-z0-9._-]+``, so no ``@``. Without that guarantee a repo literally named
# after the reserved segment could be made to collide with the provider subtree.

    analysing the queue in slices accumulates instead of overwriting.

    EXCEPT across a language change. Each cached entry carries `reason` prose, so

    another would leave the queue showing two languages at once, with nothing to

    ``verify_language`` is what makes that safe under concurrency, and it has to
    be checked HERE rather than by the caller. The caller's own pre-write check
    and this write would not be atomic, so a switch landing between them lets a

    cannot be separated. REQUIRED, not optional: there is one caller and it always
    has a language to verify against, so a default would only offer a way to write
    without the guard that makes writing safe. Refusing returns the CURRENT
    document with ``stale_language`` set, so the caller can report that nothing was
    written rather than claiming a batch it did not persist. The stored language is
    deliberately NOT echoed back: no caller reads it, and the one place that needs
    it -- the two tagging routes' servable-cache gate -- reads it from
    :func:`read_tagging_cache`, which is where it lives.

    Deliberately a callable rather than a compare-and-set on the stored tag: a CAS
    would also refuse the ordinary case of two same-language batches accumulating
    slice by slice, where the second read the document before the first wrote. What

    fetch time. Edges/nodes are normalized on the way in (native-wins dedup,
    self-edges dropped) so a caller cannot persist a malformed graph.

    ``fetched_at`` is when the graph was READ from the forge — callers capture
    ``time.time()`` before the work that produces their graph and pass it here
    (the convention ``_write_labels_cache_unlocked`` uses). It is required, not
    defaulted: stamping at write time re-dates the data — a slow rebuild that
    started earlier but finishes later would land its older graph on top of a
    newer one and mark it fresh, deferring the refetch a full
    ``DEPS_CACHE_TTL_SEC`` and blinding the sweep's unblock-transition signal.

    The write is a compare-and-set under :func:`_deps_cache_lock`: it is SKIPPED
    (silently — a skipped write is a normal outcome, not an error) when the
    stored stamp is ``>=`` the incoming one. ``>=`` rather than ``>``: an equal
    stamp means the stored graph is at least as new, and two writes in the same
    clock tick must not flip the graph back and forth. Both callers re-read the
    cache after writing, so the caller that lost serves the newer stored graph
    rather than the one it just built. Stamps are wall-clock (``time.time()``),
    matching every other cache in this module — they must be comparable to
    ``time.time()`` in the TTL checks, so a monotonic clock is not a drop-in.
    A backwards clock adjustment is handled epoch-aware: raw stamps from the
    SAME epoch (both normal, or both from the pre-retreat future) stay mutually
    comparable and the CAS applies to them unchanged; only when the stored
    stamp is more than ``_DEPS_STAMP_FUTURE_SLACK_SEC`` ahead of the wall clock
    while the incoming one is current-epoch does the write fail open — the
    incoming rebuild ran after the retreat and is newer in real time, and
    honouring the raw comparison would wedge every write (including a
    user-forced ``?refresh=1``) until wall time passed the stored stamp. The
    persisted stamp is the RAW capture — it is the CAS's ordering token, and
    clamping it to "now" at persistence would erase its epoch, letting a
    slower pre-retreat rebuild compare greater than the clamped newer write
    and overwrite it. :func:`read_deps_cache` repairs the value it RETURNS
    instead: a beyond-slack stored stamp reads as 0.0 (maximally stale, so
    the TTL refresh fires and its current-epoch write self-heals the stamp
    through the fail-open branch above), and sub-slack skew is clamped to
    "now" so the age never reads negative. The mirror quadrant — an incoming
    write whose stamp is ahead of the wall clock AT ALL against a current-epoch
    stored stamp — is ambiguous: the stored write may have run after the
    retreat (newer in real time) or may be a genuinely old cache whose expiry
    triggered the incoming rebuild, and the stamps cannot distinguish the two.
    The slack is a tolerance for a STORED stamp, not for an incoming one:
    applying it to the incoming side classified a retreat SMALLER than the
    slack as current-epoch, so the raw comparison let the older pre-retreat
    graph win and read fresh for a whole TTL. The write
    is therefore PERSISTED WITH A MAXIMALLY STALE STAMP (0.0): no completed
    refresh is ever discarded, and the stale stamp makes the very next TTL
    check refetch with a current-epoch stamp, bounding the harm in either
    reading to a single freshness-check interval. Every quadrant
    of the epoch matrix is thus decided by real-time order — or, where the
    stamps cannot decide it, forced to self-heal on the next check — and the
    residual harm in any retreat race is bounded by one TTL.

    ``issue_radar_record_investigation`` MCP tool, whose whole contract is "a
    partial update is fine", and the loss is permanent (the record is the only
    copy).

    Semantics, so callers can rely on them:

    * ``raw is None`` — explicit null CLEARS the whole findings object. This is
      the UI's clear path (``putInvestigation`` types findings as
      ``Partial<InvestigationFindings> | null``).
    * ``raw`` is a dict — each supplied, non-empty value overrides its key;
      omitted or empty values keep what is stored. ``suggested_labels`` is a
      whole value: a non-empty list replaces the stored list, an empty or
      absent one keeps it (a recommendation set is not additive). An empty dict
      is therefore a no-op, not a wipe.
    * ``raw`` is neither — malformed input keeps the stored findings rather than
      destroying them; the route and the tool schema both reject it upstream.

    There is deliberately NO per-field clear: an empty string means "leave this
    alone", which is what makes a partial patch safe for an LLM writer. Clear
    everything with an explicit null and re-write what should remain.

    All of the above is the contract for writes WITHIN one investigation run.
    Across a run boundary it is the wrong contract, and

    validated fields are applied — ``slot_key``/``folder_id`` (strings; ``""``
    clears to None), ``status`` (one of ``_INVESTIGATION_STATUSES``), and
    ``findings`` (merged per key by :func:`_merge_findings`, so a patch carrying
    only ``verdict`` keeps the stored ``root_cause``/``summary``/labels; an
    explicit ``None`` clears them). A partial patch (even ``{}``, which just bumps
    the open stamp) is valid. Returns the stored record.

    Per-key merging is right WITHIN one investigation run and wrong ACROSS runs:
    a re-run (Issue Radar's "Start over", or any path that opens a replacement
    session) that records a ``verdict`` and ``summary`` but no ``root_cause``
    would inherit the PREVIOUS run's ``root_cause``, leaving the record — the
    only copy — holding a verdict assembled from two investigations with nothing
    marking which parts came from which.

    So the run boundary is owned HERE rather than by callers, because only here
    is it atomic with the write. The record remembers the session its findings
    were written under (``findings_slot_key``), and the FIRST findings write
    under a different session REPLACES rather than merges; later writes from that
    same session merge as before. The previous verdict therefore survives right
    up until a new one exists and never blends with it — which is why the clear
    is not done when the replacement session opens (the record is the only copy,
    so an abandoned re-run would lose the prior verdict permanently).

    A boundary is only crossed when BOTH sessions are known and differ. An
    unknown owner (findings recorded through the MCP tool for an item with no
    session linked) falls back to merging: the store cannot tell those findings
    from ones the about-to-be-linked session just wrote, and merging is the
    non-destructive reading. Clearing the link (``slot_key: ""``) is not a new
    run either."""

# files) gets one file, so a PR view opens instantly (and offline) on re-visit.
# Both live under the repo's cache dir, so ``remove_connected_repo``'s rmtree
# cleans them up on disconnect. ``refresh=1`` on the route bypasses either.

# Bump when the shape of a cached PR row changes (i.e. when ``_PR_JQ`` in
# github_client gains/renames/drops a field), so an older-schema cache is a MISS
# on read and the route transparently refetches with the current field set.
#   v1: initial PR list shape
#   v2: added additions / deletions / checks_state (GraphQL list enrichment)
#   v3: added changed_files / checks_counts (per-bucket check tally on the card)
#   v4: checks_counts now collapses same-name runs, so v3 tallies are inflated
#   v5: unavailable enrichment is now null (unknown) instead of 0/empty, and rows
#       carry checks_truncated; v4 rows cannot express either
#   v6: rows carry head_sha. A bulk approve pins each verdict to the commit its row
#       was rendered at, and a v5 row has no such field — served as-is it would
#       silently disable bulk approve for every cached repo until the TTL expired,
#       which reads as a broken button rather than as a stale cache
#   v7: rows carry mergeable_state / mergeable. The bulk bar reads them to tell a PR
#       that is not ready yet (arming auto-merge is meaningful) from one that is ready
#       NOW (GitHub REFUSES to arm, "Pull request is in clean status"). A v6 row has
#       neither field, and an absent value is indistinguishable from "not ready" — so
