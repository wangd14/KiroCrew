"""The backend process table: records, lifecycle generations, and in-flight starts.

``_processes`` maps an app name to the ONE :class:`AppProcess` the gateway currently
tracks for it, and every lifecycle writer mutates it under ``_lock``. A record is
identified by the object, never by its name: a stop/start installs a new record under
the same name, and every retiring thread compares ``_processes.get(name) is ap``
before it acts. ``_lifecycle_generation`` is the per-app token a restart compares
to tell a later deliberate stop from a later start; ``_advance_lifecycle_locked`` is
its only writer. The STARTING placeholder a spawn inserts, the cross-process spawn
flock, and the wait on an in-flight spawn are the single-flight half of the same
table.
