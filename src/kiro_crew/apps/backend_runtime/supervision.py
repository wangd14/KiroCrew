"""A backend's health as a standing observation: the startup poll and the liveness watch.

One daemon thread per record, bound to that record from the spawn: it polls until the
backend first answers, then keeps watching at the coarser ``_HEALTH_WATCH_INTERVAL`` for
as long as the SAME record stays tracked. Each sweep re-reads the execution ceiling
before it judges health, demotes a live process only after consecutive misses, treats an
exited spawned process as decisive, and hands it to the restart supervisor once its MCP
scrub has landed.

    ``stopped`` - it is gone; the watch is done. ``retry`` - the ceiling is closed
    and the stop did not take, so the caller must SKIP its health judgement this
    sweep (see the promotion hazard where that is returned). ``proceed`` - nothing
    was revoked, so the sweep carries on: the ceiling does not apply, or a fault
    left the question unanswered and the liveness watch must keep working.

    Turning ``agent.apps_allow_third_party`` off has to stop the code it was
    admitting, and the setting has three writers: the dashboard endpoint, which
    sweeps on the falling edge; the CLI; and a text editor. Only the endpoint
    sweeps, and the boot reconcile in :func:`start_enabled_app_backends` revokes
    at the NEXT start, so without this a backend admitted solely by the blanket
    flag keeps serving under a ceiling the operator has closed: trust withdrawn
    on paper only, the one failure this control exists to prevent.

    This watch is the only thing that already revisits every live backend, so
    enforcing here adds no task, no interval, and no setting: a closed ceiling
    stops the process within one sweep whatever route closed it.

    Scope is the EXECUTING surface and stops there. An app holding its own
    ``agent.apps_trusted`` grant is untouched: that permission is independent of
    the blanket flag. Builtins are exempt at the gate on shipped provenance.
    Non-executable derivative resources (agents, skills, MCP declarations, cron
    definitions) sit outside the ceiling by contract and belong to the lifecycle
    lock's owners; a cron or hook that tries to RUN app code meets
    ``app_execution_denied`` and fails closed on its own.

    No ``on_shutdown`` hook is attempted, and that is not an oversight. The flag
    is already false by the time this observes it, so ``load_app_module`` refuses
    to load the hook, which is the state the endpoint's post-write second pass
    also runs in. Pretending to run it would report a teardown that cannot happen.
    This is why the endpoint remains the better route for withdrawing trust.

    Never raises: the enclosing sweep is wrapped, but a fault here costs the
    liveness watch that other code depends on, so a failed revocation is logged
    and retried on the next sweep instead.

    Without this the startup poll would leave ``healthy`` a write-once cache: a backend
    that died an hour later would still be routed to by the reverse proxy
    (:func:`get_app_backend_port` gates purely on the flag) and still reported
    ``healthy`` by ``/api/apps``.

    Liveness is checked cheapest-first. For a backend we spawned, ``Popen.poll()``
    answers from an already-reaped exit status with no syscall to the app at all and is
    DECISIVE — an exited process cannot come back on its own, so one observation demotes
    it and the watch stops. An adopted backend has no ``Popen`` handle (it belongs to
    another supervisor) and is judged by the health endpoint alone.

    An HTTP failure from a process that is still alive is NOT decisive: it may be a slow
    request or a GC pause, so demotion needs `_HEALTH_WATCH_FAILURES` consecutive misses
    and stays REVERSIBLE — the watch keeps running and re-promotes on the next success,
    which is what lets an app that wedged briefly heal without operator action.

    Exits when the record stops being the tracked one for its app: ``stop_app_backend``
    pops it and a restart replaces it, so this needs no separate teardown — the same
    "not the tracked record" guard the startup poll uses.
