"""Restarting an exited spawned backend through the ordinary spawn path.

The health watch hands a still-tracked, exited record here once its MCP scrub landed.
The replacement is spawned by the facade's ``_start_app_backend``, so it gets the
pidfile record, health gate, MCP promotion and single-flight of every other start
without recording an external START; the lifecycle generation snapshot then tells a
later deliberate stop from a later start. Fast retries give way to a slow steady cadence
while the app stays positively enabled.
