"""Stopping a backend, and draining the whole tree a spawned backend leaves.

A spawned backend leads its own process group (POSIX) or anchors its tree by its root's
creation identity (Windows), so every exit that signals one reaches the tree, root alive
or not. Nothing here signals a PID it cannot name: an adopted backend's recorded PIDs are
signalled only while their start-time identities still match, and an exited root's group
is reached only through members vouched by the spawn's instance token.

    instead and drains the descendants it still anchors, confirming their exit.

    The root has exited -- that is why the caller is here -- but the processes it
    forked have not necessarily: a launcher that starts the real server and returns
    0 is the shape this guards. Three callers: the startup-survival failure branch,
    where no ``AppProcess`` and no pidfile row exist yet, so nothing later would
    ever name those survivors; ``stop_app_backend`` for a tracked record whose root
    exited after startup while a child kept serving; and the health supervisor's
    restart, which drops that same record before spawning a replacement. In each
    the record is being dropped, so this is the last exit that can still reach the
    tree.

    Returns what the caller may CONCLUDE about the tree, because a stop under a
    withdrawn trust ceiling has to refuse rather than report a success it cannot
    support: ``True`` when the tree is positively gone, ``False`` when a member
    positively survives the drain, ``None`` when nothing can be concluded (no
    identity or token to vouch by, a host that cannot read the vouch, a cleanup
    capacity refusal). Absence is never inferred from an empty census.

    Windows: the exact-handle drain, keyed on the root identity the caller read
    BEFORE the survival check (an exited root's creation time cannot be probed
    afresh once its ``Popen`` handle goes). It confirms exit or raises, so its
    ``True`` is the conclusion. A capacity refusal or a drain that raises leaves
    the tree to the cleanup registry's maintenance, as the stale reaper does; a
    numeric ``taskkill`` fallback is pointless here because the root it would walk
    from is the exited one.

    POSIX: the group outlives its leader and its id is the leader's pid, but
    ``kill_process_tree`` cannot be used -- ``getpgid`` raises for a reaped pid --
    and signalling the bare group NUMBER is refused for the reason
    ``_reap_orphaned_backend_group`` gives. So it takes the same route as that
    reaper: members vouched by this spawn's instance token, each signalled pinned
    to its own identity, then a SIGKILL pass after the reap's grace that is ALSO
    the final census. That pass runs unconditionally, exactly as the reaper's does:
    the opening census cannot contain a member the SIGTERM itself caused to be
    forked (a server whose handler forks a replacement into the same group), so
    the conclusion is read off the final reading -- no live vouched member AND
    ``pgroup_exists`` False -- never off the signalled set or the opening snapshot.
    Off Linux the vouch cannot be read, nothing is signalled and the decline is
    logged -- the same trade the reaper makes.
