"""App backend process management — spawn, health check, stop, and proxy config.

When an app declares a ``backend`` section in its manifest, KiroCrew manages
the backend process lifecycle: spawn on enable, health-check, stop on disable.

This module is the backend's only import path and patch surface. Its rules live in
private owners under :mod:`kiro_crew.apps.backend_runtime`, one per responsibility
(``docs/system-specs/modules/app-kit-platform.md`` §21 has the map), and every name
they hold resolves here. Two constructs stay in this file because repository guards
read them here by path: the spawn transaction (:func:`start_app_backend`,
:func:`_start_app_backend` and :func:`_start_app_backend_body`, with the entry-point
helpers only it uses) and :func:`_pid_alive`.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Composition: one import path and one patch surface over the owners
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# The backend is split by responsibility across ``backend_runtime``, and this module is
# its only import path. Callers and tests reach every name as ``backend.X`` -- private
# helpers and the process table included, because tests read, clear and patch them --
# so two properties hold.
#
# 1. A read answers with the object the owner holds. A name this module does not use
#    itself is NOT bound here: ``__getattr__`` reads it from its owner on each access,
#    through ``sys.modules``, which is the one-storage rule
#    ``test_mirrored_owner_storage.py`` enforces on every module of this shape. The
#    names this module's own functions use are bound here by ordinary imports, the
#    same way each owner binds what it imports from a lower owner.
# 2. A write reaches every binding of the name. An owner resolves a name through its
#    own globals, and so does every owner that imported it, so a patch that landed
#    only on this module would leave the code under test running the unpatched
#    object -- the test would pass while testing nothing. ``_Facade`` therefore
#    writes the value into every module that holds the name, which keeps the backend
#    one namespace for writes: replacing ``_processes`` or shadowing a builtin reaches
#    every owner as well. Patch the facade, never an owner directly: a write into one
#    owner reaches no other holder.
#
# The mutable state (``_processes``, ``_allocated_ports``, the locks, the lifecycle
# generations) is ONE object per name, defined once in its owner and imported by the
# owners that act on it, so a ``.clear()`` through the facade empties the table every
# owner reads. The two flags rebound with ``global`` each have one holder: the spawn
# body's ``_warned_unconfined_cache`` here, and ``startup._DEV_FLEET_DEFERRED``.
#
# Every owner is imported here, at the facade's own import. An owner's
# ``from ... import`` bindings are therefore taken once, as the one-module backend
# took them, and never on a first use that could fall inside a test's patch.
#
# One consequence of (1) is visible to a patch harness. ``mock.patch`` undoes a name
# this module does not bind by deleting it and then writing the original back -- and
# under ``create=True`` it only deletes -- and the delete reaches every holder. So a
# patch of such a name never passes ``create=True``: the composition-contract test
# fails on any test module that patches a forwarded name with ``create=True``, apart
# from its one allowlisted premise case.
#
# The machinery below holds dotted module NAMES, never module objects, and reads
# ``sys``, ``importlib`` and ``builtins`` through private aliases a patch of
# ``backend.sys`` cannot redirect. The composition-contract test pins that every
# module holding a name holds the SAME object, so a name and the symbol it denotes
# cannot come apart.

#: The owners, lowest layer first. An owner imports only owners earlier in this
#: order, so for a name the backend defines, the first owner holding it is its
#: definer; a name an owner imports from outside the backend resolves from its first
#: importer, which holds the same object as every other holder.
