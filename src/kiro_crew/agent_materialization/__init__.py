"""The owners behind :mod:`kiro_crew.agent`, the agent-spec materialization facade.

``kiro_crew.agent`` stays the one import path: callers, tests and documents reach every
name as ``kiro_crew.agent.<name>``, and a patch there reaches the owner that reads the
name. Nothing outside ``kiro_crew.agent`` and this package imports an owner, so the
layout below can change without touching a caller.

* :mod:`.kiro_hooks` -- the spec ``hooks`` field: validation, both spec shapes, the
  autoimport scan and the merge. The legacy-key repair of the specs Kiro Crew owns
  stays :func:`kiro_crew.agent.repair_agent_configs`.
* :mod:`.managed_mcp` -- policy over the managed MCP registry: emission eligibility,
  the gate snapshot, the data-home pin, the registry marker and field ownership.
* :mod:`.mcp_aliases` -- MCP server-key aliasing and the Connections tool aliases.
* :mod:`.auto_approve` -- what a spec may auto-approve under the governance ceiling,
  and the KAS ``permissions`` block derived from it.
* :mod:`.mcp_sources` -- projecting the app, global and dashboard-store MCP sources
  into the default spec during a rebuild.
* :mod:`.default_spec_commit` -- the rebuild's locked write of the default spec.
* :mod:`.fork_refresh` -- the governance refresh of crews' private template copies.
* :mod:`.service_agents` -- the lite, guest, knowledge and research agents.
* :mod:`.conductor_agents` -- the four conductor specs.
* :mod:`.worker_agent` -- the worker's mirror of the default spec and its spawn-time
  freshness gate.
* :mod:`.assistant_agent` -- the ``kirocrew-assistant`` template and the one-time
  creation of the built-in ``assistant`` member that runs it.

Importing this package imports the facade first, and the facade imports every owner
once its own names are bound, so no owner can be observed half-built whichever module
a caller imports first.
