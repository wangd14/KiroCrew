"""The session control: waiting, monitoring loops, questions, and follow-ups tools: what they advertise and what they do.

``schemas()`` returns the ADVERTISEMENT half of each tool -- its name, the
model-facing description, and the JSON Schema a call is validated against.
``HANDLERS`` maps each of those names to the function that runs it. Both halves
of a tool live here so its contract and its behavior are read together, and
``test_mcp_tool_registry`` fails if one arrives without the other.

Handlers reach this server's shared plumbing as attributes of ``mcp_core`` --
``mcp_core._post``, the identity resolvers, the governance vets. That is
deliberate rather than untidy: an attribute lookup resolves at CALL time, so a
test that rebinds one on the module still intercepts the handler. Importing
those names directly here would bind them at import time and silently escape
every existing patch site.

#: description moves, and neither tool is refused.
#:
#: The two positions are NOT two different routes. Both send evidence the typed

#: loop. What moves is the burden: off, the structured path is admissible only
#: once the caller has satisfied itself the objective is fully typed-decidable,
#: which is a judgement that leans to the loop whenever the caller is unsure; on,
#: a supported pull request is enough and the loop is the exception that needs its
#: own reason. Describing this as a swap of two defaults would be false, and the
#: help text does not.
#:
#: Both positions are spelled out in full rather than built from a shared stem.
#: The off text has to make a positive claim of its own, because a test can tell
#: "the flag was read and resolved off" from "the flag was never read" only when
#: the two positions say different things -- an off position that merely OMITS
#: the structured wording is indistinguishable from a read that never happened.

def _prefers_structured_arming() -> bool:
    """Whether this installation arms the structured monitor by default.

    Read fresh on every descriptor build. That is what keeps a Settings change
    from needing a gateway restart: ``mcp_tools.build_tool_list`` rebuilds the
    descriptors per call and deliberately does not cache them. It does NOT
    reach a session that is already open, because kiro-cli caches a session's
    tool list for that session's life -- the same limitation
    ``mcp_tools/browser.py`` records for ``dashboard.use_builtin_browser``.

    Skipped entirely when an event loop is running, the same rule
    ``mcp_tools/spawn.py::_agent_roster_hint`` applies for the same caller: a
    running loop means this is NOT the stdio server but
    ``mcp_discovery._managed_tools_in_process``, calling ``_list_tools()`` from
    ``async def probe_server`` on the gateway's loop. That caller keeps only tool
    NAMES -- it returns ``t.get("name")`` per entry and discards every
    description -- so reading config there could not change anything it uses, and
    the read is skipped rather than charged to the loop. The process that
    actually serves ``tools/list`` to a model is ``mcp_shared.run_mcp_stdio_loop``,
    a plain select/readline loop that never imports asyncio, so no loop is running
    there and the preference IS read.

    Fails to the OFF position on any error: off is the shipped behaviour, and a
    config a gateway cannot parse must not silently re-point every arming
    decision it is about to advise on. The catch stays broad because this runs
    inside the tool-list build, where an escaping exception would withdraw EVERY
    tool rather than one sentence -- so the failure is logged instead of
    narrowed, which is what keeps a defect here discoverable rather than
    concealed.

    """Encode a validated directive AND publish it out of band; return the text.

    Two delivery paths, one each way round:

    * The MARKER in the returned text is the original path. A consumer that can
      verify the call's ``_meta.kiro`` identity (kiro-cli) decodes and applies it
      from there, exactly as before — this function changes nothing for that
      backend.
    * The out-of-band POST is the provider-neutral path. ``_post`` already carries
      ``X-Session-Key`` (and the gateway kernel-verifies that claim on the unix
      socket), so the gateway parks the payload for the RIGHT session without the
      model's tool result being trusted for anything. What travels is the CALL
      (tool name + raw arguments), never the payload: the gateway re-runs this
      tool on those arguments to derive the payload and computes the claim key
      itself, and the consumer recomputes that key from the ``tool_call``
      frame — so neither the result body's shape nor a caller-authored payload
      decides what lands. A backend that emits no ``_meta.kiro`` identity has
      no other way to reach its own control plane.

    Order matters: encode FIRST. ``encode`` refuses an oversized payload by
    returning a marker-less error string, and a refused directive must NOT be
    published — otherwise the model is told "nothing was applied" while a record
    sits waiting to apply it.

    Fail-soft on the POST, and SILENT by design. An older gateway with no such
    route, or one that is simply down, must not turn a working tool call into an
    error: the marker is already in hand and the kiro-cli path still works. There
    is no log line because this module runs as a stdio MCP server, where the
    process's own streams are the protocol channel — and because the failure that
    matters is reported at the CONSUMER, which is the side that knows whether a
    directive actually landed.

    refusal decided there cannot reach the model in the arming turn, so without a
    preflight the model ends its turn holding a "requested" ack for a monitor that
    does not exist. This is the only place that can say otherwise in time.

    Reads the endpoint ``monitor_inspect`` already reads, so it grants no new
    capability, and NEVER writes: clearing retained evidence stays owner-only.

    SKIPPED ENTIRELY during gateway-side directive replay
    (:func:`mcp_core.directive_capture_active`). That run discards this text, and
    the read would be a blocking loopback request to the very gateway whose event
    loop is synchronously waiting on this call -- it could not be answered, and
    every co-hosted session would stall until the timeout. Nothing is lost: the
    preflight exists to reach the MODEL in the arming turn, which only the MCP-side
    run can do, and the turn boundary still refuses the arm on its own.

    Fails OPEN -- an unreadable gateway returns ``""`` and the caller emits as
    before, because failing closed would let one bad read block all arming. The
    turn boundary remains the enforcement point, so both TOCTOU directions are
    benign: a record cleared just after the read costs one retryable refusal, and
    one written just after it is still caught authoritatively.

    Scope is the STRUCTURED record, the only one the endpoint reports an outcome
