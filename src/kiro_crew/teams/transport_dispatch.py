"""Full new-path dispatch: TeamsTransport -> TurnDriver -> TeamsRenderer.

``TeamsTransport.receive()`` scope-gates + authorizes + normalizes an inbound
activity and hands the ``TeamsInbound`` (carrying ``conversation_id`` +
``service_url``) to :meth:`TeamsDispatcher.handle_message`:

    command intercept (COMMAND_SPEC: /new /compact /stop /yolo /link /unlink
                       /dashboard /help,
                       plus the /queue and /steer per-message directives)
    -> mid-turn routing: steer the running turn, or queue it behind a single
       in-place receipt bubble and drain the burst as ONE combined turn
    -> construct TeamsRenderer + on_turn_start (typing indicator)
    -> session acquire -> context build
    -> drive_turn -> TurnDriver   # shared redaction + approval ladder + audit
    -> post-turn (record_success, persist, soft/hard threshold notice)  # guarded
    -> renderer.close() + session release   # in finally

Tool approval is an Adaptive Card. Its ``Action.Submit`` returns as an ordinary
message activity carrying ``value``, which :meth:`_handle_card_action` resolves
against the awaiting ``TeamsApprovalDecider`` -- so a click is never a turn.
``ChannelTurn.auto_approve_session`` additionally honours a "Trust session" grant
and the operator's process-wide grant, letting a user stop being asked per tool.

The security ``tool_gate`` and the ``spawn_run`` auto-approve are wired by the
shared pipeline off ``ctx_builder.hooks`` (channel-neutral), so this module never
imports ``kiro_crew.slack``.

Dependency direction is ``teams -> messaging`` (allowed).
