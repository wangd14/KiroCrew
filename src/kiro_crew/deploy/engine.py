"""deploy-web core engine — deterministic 6-step deploy via the ``aws`` CLI.

All AWS work shells to the ``aws`` CLI as a subprocess with ``--profile`` (never
boto3 — credential resolution stays in the external CLI process, preserving the
``sync/s3.py`` boundary and the design §6.1 non-goals). Every subprocess call
goes through :func:`run_aws`, the single chokepoint unit tests monkeypatch.

Flow (design §4):
  bucket → OAC → distribution (tagged at creation) → bucket-policy (pins the
  distribution ARN, MUST come after create-distribution) → s3 sync → invalidate
  → return the ``*.cloudfront.net`` URL.

State is stateless-by-tag (§5): re-deploy of the same logical ``site_id`` finds
the existing bucket + distribution by the ``kirocrew:site`` tag and reuses them
(idempotent), so the public URL stays stable. The physical bucket name is an
opaque ``kirocrew-web-<random>`` (no account id); idempotency never relies on
re-deriving it.

    ``argv_head`` is the argv head the caller is about to spawn, already resolved
    by the caller (:func:`resolve_aws_bin` for ``aws``,
    ``instances.token_mint.resolve_ssh_bin`` for ``ssh``). It is required, not
    optional: see the fail-closed rule below, which cannot be enforced without it.

    Resolving our own argv head absolutely is not sufficient for ``aws ssm
    start-session``: the CLI locates ``session-manager-plugin`` itself, by name,
    against the CHILD's inherited ``PATH`` at exec time. A GUI-launched gateway
    hands the child the minimal launchd ``PATH``, so the tunnel dies inside a
    correctly-resolved ``aws`` — the resolver cannot reach that lookup, only the
    child's environment can. Passing this as ``env=`` is therefore the
    other half of the same fix, not a duplicate of it.

    ``ssh`` has the identical gap one level further out. A tunnel, token mint or
    probe to a host whose ``~/.ssh/config`` routes through a ``ProxyCommand``
    runs that command under the ssh child's ``PATH``, and the proxies in real use
    (an SSM connect helper, ``aws ssm start-session``) look ``session-manager-plugin``
    or ``aws`` up by name — so under a GUI-launched gateway ``ssh`` exited 255
    with "session-manager-plugin is not installed" while the plugin sat in
    ``/usr/local/bin``. Those children get this same env, under this same rule.

    APPENDED, never prepended: the inherited ``PATH`` keeps first claim on every
    name, so this can only make an otherwise-unresolvable lookup succeed and can
    never re-point one the child already resolved. That is the whole trust
    argument for widening a credential-bearing child's ``PATH`` at all, and it is
    also why this is not :func:`kiro_crew.env.augmented_path`, which PREPENDS a
    broader set (``~/.local/bin``, npm/mise/volta shims) — the right search space
    for finding an MCP launcher, too wide and wrongly-ordered ahead of ``/usr/bin``
    for a child holding AWS credentials and a live tunnel to the user's box.

    **A non-absolute ``argv_head`` returns the env UNWIDENED.** This is the one case
    where "can only make an unresolvable lookup succeed" is not a safety argument
    but the hazard itself: :func:`resolve_aws_tool_bin` falls back to the bare name
    precisely when it found a candidate in these dirs and
    ``validate_provider_executable`` REFUSED it, and that refusal is enforced only
    by the bare name failing ``execvp`` against a ``PATH`` those dirs are absent
    from. Widening the child's ``PATH`` would put the refused binary back on it and
    hand it AWS credentials — converting a fail-closed rejection into an execution.
    So the widening is offered only to a head that was already resolved
    absolutely, where ``execvp`` performs no ``PATH`` search at all and the dirs
    can affect nothing but the CLI's own onward lookups.
    ``ssh`` meets the rule the same way from the other side: its resolver
    searches only the inherited ``PATH`` (the trust class the bare ``"ssh"`` argv
    already had), so a bare head means no ``ssh`` there, and widening would hand
    execvp an ``ssh`` found only in these dirs that nothing vetted.

    Dirs already on ``PATH`` are not repeated, so a terminal-launched gateway
    (whose ``PATH`` carries them) gets a byte-identical env and the fix is inert
    outside the minimal-PATH case it exists for.

    Unlike the resolvers above this touches no filesystem — it is a dict copy and
    a string join over ``os.environ`` — so it is safe to call directly on the
    gateway event loop, where a PATH scan would not be.

    routed through the same OS-level sandbox (:func:`wrap_argv`) as every other

    must read ``~/.aws`` to resolve credentials; the argv is fixed (no shell, no

    ``extra_visible_dirs`` re-exposes an agent-hidden tree to THIS spawn alone: a
