    kiro-cli's spec schema and KAS's wire schema type the field as a boolean and

    own deletes so kiro-cli does not try to mount a server absent from the map,
    and ``agent_capabilities._materialize`` filters ``allowedTools`` on exactly
    this test -- and this is where it holds for the assembled agent config, whose
    server map several passes narrow without touching the ref lists (the
    resolution pass replaces ``mcpServers`` wholesale, dropping unresolvable
    servers by OMISSION; the locked app re-merge ``del``\\ etes app entries whose
    app is not confirmed enabled). One reconcile over the FINAL map covers every
    such pass, including one added later.

    A dangling ``allowedTools`` ref is the one that costs something: that list is
    the path that never reaches the PreToolUse gate, so the grant sits on the NAME
    and a server added under it inherits an auto-approval nobody granted for it.

    *declared* names servers whose absence from the map this caller EXPECTS and a
    later pass reverses, so they are not leftovers. Two such classes exist in the
    rebuild, and both are unrecoverable if their refs are dropped, because an
    existing config deliberately never re-adds a template ref: a server whose
    command fails to resolve on this pass (a binary missing from this rebuild's
    PATH), and a gated-off shipped server whose entry is withheld while its
    ``tools`` ref is retained by design. The resolution case also reaches the
    per-tool grant, which nothing re-emits -- the rebuild's ref sync only ever
    writes whole-server ``@alias`` refs. Refs outlive one bad PATH; a lost grant
    does not.

    A ``@`` name in :data:`RESERVED_TOOL_NAMESPACES` addresses a kiro namespace
    rather than a server, so it is never in the map and is never a leftover.
    ``@builtin`` is the one kiro's configuration reference lists, and it carries
    the whole built-in tool surface plus the ``tool_search`` loader, so reading it
    as a dangling server ref would unmount all of that on every rebuild.

    Fails safe in both directions: a ``mcpServers`` that is not a dict yields no
    readable verdict, so nothing is dropped, and a non-string or sigil-less entry
    is left for the passes that own it.

    Mutates *config* in place. Returns the refs removed, first occurrence order.

    *declared_grants* is the same kind of set for ``allowedTools`` alone, and it
    exists because the two lists fail in opposite directions. Keeping a mount ref
    too long costs a mount attempt against a name that holds nothing; dropping one
    can unmount a server for good, since an existing config never re-adds a
    template ref. Keeping a GRANT too long hands the next server on that name an
    auto-approval nobody granted, on the one list that never reaches the
    PreToolUse gate; dropping one costs an approval a human can give again. So a
    caller that is UNSURE whether a name is still owned should name it in
    *declared* and leave it out of *declared_grants*: the mount survives the doubt
    and the grant does not. Defaults to *declared*, so a caller with no such
