"""Full new-path dispatch: WeixinTransport -> TurnDriver -> WeixinRenderer.

``WeixinTransport.receive()`` authorizes + normalizes an inbound iLink message
and hands the neutral ``InboundMessage`` to :meth:`WeixinDispatcher.handle_message`,
which mirrors the WeCom/Telegram transport dispatch:

    command intercept (/new, /compact)
    -> construct WeixinRenderer + on_turn_start (typing indicator on)
    -> session acquire -> context build
    -> TurnDriver.run(provider, renderer)   # shared redaction + approval ladder
    -> post-turn (record_success, persist, soft/hard threshold notice)  # guarded
    -> renderer.close() + session release   # in finally

iLink has no interactive buttons and no callback handler, so the driver runs
``decider``-less. That alone would leave the INTERACTIVE ladder denying every
tool, so ``ChannelTurn.auto_approve_session`` carries the process-global
safety-override grant (``auto``/``trust`` modes still auto-approve on their
own). The security ``tool_gate`` and the ``spawn_run`` auto-approve are wired by
the shared pipeline off ``ctx_builder.hooks`` (channel-neutral) so this module
never imports ``kiro_crew.slack``.

Unlike WeCom, iLink CAN send proactively (a reply is not bound to the inbound
request), so a mid-turn message is queued via steer and, when no turn is live,
simply run as a fresh turn.

Dependency direction is ``weixin -> messaging`` (allowed).
