"""Project scanner — detect the packages in a directory tree, and nothing else.

A chat folder already carries a ``project_dir`` and nests via ``parent_id``, so a
chat opened inside one is steering- and scope-correct for its package. What is
missing for a monorepo, or a directory of sibling repositories, is *population*:
assembling N sub-folders by hand is work nobody does, so per-package steering
never loads. This module supplies the detection half of that — the folder tree is
then built by composing the existing folder API, which stays the only writer.

Two properties define the module and are worth stating up front:

* **Read-only and pure.** Detection depends on the filesystem and the passed
  configuration, and on nothing else: no writes, no state, no editor workspace
  artifacts. That is what makes a scan safe to point at an unfamiliar tree, and
  what makes :class:`CandidateTree` reproducible across runs. The only files
  *opened* are workspace declarations (see :data:`WORKSPACE_DECLARATIONS`) and
  ``.gitignore`` files, and only when found as regular files while walking —
  never through a link. A ``.gitignore`` is filesystem content like everything
  else here, so honouring it keeps the scan a pure function of the tree: two
  scans of an unchanged tree still compare equal.
* **Prune beats every signal.** A name in :data:`PRUNE_DIRS` is rejected before
  it is ever classified, so a vendored ``node_modules/left-pad/package.json``
  cannot become a candidate no matter how well it matches. The precedence is
  one-directional on purpose — the alternative (classify, then filter) leaks a
  candidate the moment a new signal is added without a matching filter.
* **Gitignored is pruned.** The project's own ``.gitignore`` already says which
  trees are not its source, so the scan believes it instead of enumerating
  every build tool's directory name: an ignored directory is never entered and
  never classified — a ``.git`` inside it cannot rescue it, which is exactly
  what defeats the SwiftPM/Xcode shape (``tmp/derived_data/SourcePackages/
  checkouts/`` holds every dependency as a full clone) — and an ignored file
  contributes nothing, neither a manifest signal nor a workspace declaration.
  Matching follows git semantics (nested files stack, deeper files win,
  ``!negation`` re-includes) via ``pathspec``. Only ``.gitignore`` files at or
  below the scan root are read: a parent directory's file is outside the tree
  the user pointed at, and the scanner never reads outside that tree.

Classification is two-tiered rather than boolean because the confidence differs:
a repository or manifest at the top of the scan root is what the user pointed at,
while a directory *inside* a package may be a real sub-package or may be an
implementation detail. So the tree offers both and lets the preview decide what
is ticked by default — see :class:`Tier`.
