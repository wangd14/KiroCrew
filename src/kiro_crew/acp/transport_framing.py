"""Stdio JSON-RPC framing shared by both ACP transports.

``AcpClient`` (one harness process per session) and ``AcpRuntime`` (one process
multiplexed across sessions) exchange newline-delimited JSON-RPC frames over the
harness's stdio. This module owns the parts of that framing both transports share:
discarding one oversize stdout line while keeping the stream on a frame boundary, and
bounding a response or notification write by the reader's progress rather than by
elapsed time. Each transport keeps its own write lock, pending-request table and the

# prompt frame queued ahead of the response on the same writer (the shared
# runtime multiplexes sessions on one stdin). The two are told apart by
# progress, not by elapsed time: the bound is the longest the transport's
# write buffer may go without shrinking. A reader that is consuming, however
# slowly, keeps the wait alive; a reader that consumed nothing for this long
# is gone, and the write is raised as the process death it is (AcpProcessDied
# / AcpRuntimeDead) so the caller takes the same session-reset + bounded-
# requeue recovery the broken-pipe case already uses. The bound cannot observe
# delivery of a frame the pipe accepted (the protocol gives no ack for a
# response); it bounds the wait on a paused writer. Sized like chat_runner's

# killed by the cap -- the very failure the progress bound exists to avoid.
