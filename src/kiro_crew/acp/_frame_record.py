"""Opt-in recorder for raw ACP frames, both directions — a no-op unless switched on.

Set ``KIROCREW_ACP_RECORD_FRAMES`` to a directory and every agent->client
JSON-RPC frame the two transports read is appended, one JSON object per line, to
``<dir>/<backend>.jsonl``, and every client->agent frame the two transports
WRITE (``session/prompt``, ``session/new``, ``session/cancel``, permission
answers) is appended to ``<dir>/<backend>.out.jsonl``. The two directions are
two files on purpose: the inbound file is the replay corpus's raw material
(below) and must stay exactly what the backend's stdout carried, while the
outbound file is a debugging aid — "what did we actually send this turn" — that
the replay test never reads. Unset — which is every ordinary run, and every CI
run — :func:`record_frame` returns after one environment lookup and touches nothing.

Why it exists: the replay corpus under ``test/fixtures/acp_frames/`` is the
behavioural gate that stops a refactor of the dispatch layer silently changing
what a backend's frames become, and a corpus is only worth trusting if a human
can regenerate it from a real backend rather than hand-writing what they assume
the wire looks like. The corpus README (``test/fixtures/acp_frames/README.md``,
introduced with the corpus) documents the recording procedure and the review a
recording must pass before it is committed.

Four properties this module owes the reader loops that call it, because it sits
on the hot path of every frame of every session:

* **It never waits on the reader loop.** :func:`record_frame` puts the frame on
  ONE process-wide, thread-safe, bounded queue and returns; a single daemon
  thread drains it in arrival order. One queue and one writer for the whole
  process, not one per event loop: the two transports read on different
  threads and loops (``AcpRuntime`` on the gateway loop, ``AcpClient`` on a
  worker's), and a writer bound to "the loop that first recorded" would be
  replaced each time the other loop recorded, leaving several writers
  appending to the same file concurrently and each holding its own copy of
  the byte budget. So neither a slow disk nor a wedged executor can hold a
  frame back from routing — a reader loop that waited on either would stall
  every multiplexed session until the liveness watchdog ended the process.
  The writer is a dedicated thread rather than a job on the shared
  ``subprocess_executor``: the recorder must not compete with, or be starved
  by, the pool that runs tool subprocesses. It is started by
  :func:`start_recorder` at import time, on the importing thread, and never
  from a reader loop: ``Thread.start()`` waits for the OS to schedule the new
  thread, which is unbounded on a starved host, and every lazy scheme
  (``to_thread``, a private bootstrap pool) still paid one such start on the
  loop. If the switch is set after import without ``start_recorder`` being
  called, recording stands down with a line saying so. The queue is bounded in BYTES as well
  as frames: a frame may be up to the transports' 10 MiB line limit, so a count
  alone would let a burst of large frames hold gigabytes of parsed JSON behind
  one writer. A full queue drops the frame and stands recording down rather
  than blocking or growing.
  The price of never waiting is that the recording is not durable across a
  hard exit. A frame still queued when the process ends is lost, and a process
  ending in the middle of an append (one open/append/close per frame) can
  leave a torn last line. Both cost the last few milliseconds of a session, and
  a human regenerating a fixture stops the gateway after the scenario is done;
  the README's review step is what catches a torn tail before it is committed.
  Nothing in the gateway's shutdown path awaits this module, by design:
  recording is a development aid and must never add a step to shutdown.
* **It never raises.** A recorder fault must not reach a reader loop: in
  ``AcpRuntime._reader_loop`` an exception tears down EVERY multiplexed session
  on that process, which a user sees as an unexplained chat failure. Every
  failure mode degrades to one log line and a permanent stand-down, after which
  anything still queued is discarded unwritten — one failure costs one line,
  not one per pending frame.
* **It redacts before it writes.** Frames carry tool output, prompts and
  transcripts. Recording runs every string leaf (keys and values, at any
  depth) through the same
  :func:`kiro_crew.acp._dispatch.redact_text` the dashboard path runs, plus a
  home-directory scrub, BEFORE serialization so redaction can never eat JSON
  syntax and every recorded line parses. An accidental commit of a raw
  recording is then not an
  accidental commit of a credential. That is a floor and not a guarantee — see
  the README's review step, which is what actually keeps account ids and
  private paths out of the corpus.
* **The recording is owner-only on disk, and lands where the operator said.**
  Redaction is best-effort, and a recording sits on a developer machine for as
  long as they take to review it. On POSIX the destination is PINNED by
  :mod:`kiro_crew.pinned_fs`, the one home for that mechanism: the parent
  chain is resolved once, every component is opened relative to the previous
  descriptor with ``O_DIRECTORY | O_NOFOLLOW``, the leaf is created (0o700)
  through that descriptor, and the file is opened relative to it with
  ``O_NOFOLLOW`` and tightened (``fchmod`` 0o600) on its own descriptor.
  A path that already crosses a link is refused outright (the recording must
  land where the env var reads, not where a link points), and nothing on the
  way to the frame is resolved by name through a link after that, so another
  local user who can write to an ancestor cannot redirect the recording by
  swapping a link in between check and use, and a planted symlink or hard
  link at the target is refused. Whatever the pinned descriptor lands on must
  then be owned by this user and owner-only in mode, or the recording stands
  down. The mode is
  not the whole story: a 0700 directory can still carry a POSIX ACL that grants
  another account, and a file created inside inherits the directory's default
  ACL, so both descriptors are also checked for an extended ACL
  (``system.posix_acl_access`` / ``_default`` xattrs) and refused if one is
  present. That check exists only on Linux; macOS keeps ACLs behind
  ``acl_get_file`` with no xattr view, so a macOS process cannot prove the
  recording is owner-only and stands down like Windows does. The recorder
  is Linux-only for exactly this reason: Windows has neither ``dir_fd`` nor
  ``O_NOFOLLOW``, its DACL lockdown is applied by path after the open, and an
  ancestor another account can rename in cannot be pinned, so every
  path-based check there leaves a swap window. Rather than ship a recorder
  whose owner-only guarantee holds on one platform and is best-effort on the
  other, a Windows process with the env var set stands down once with a log
  line naming the reason. The corpus is regenerated on a POSIX host.

    If the env var was set after import without :func:`start_recorder` being
    called, recording stands down with a line saying so rather than starting a
    thread from the loop.

    *wire_bytes* is the length of the line *frame* was parsed from (inbound) or
    was written as (outbound — every stdin writer records AFTER its write call
    returned, so a frame the pipe refused never appears in the capture as
    sent). The callers already hold it, and it is
    what the byte bound counts — serializing the frame here to measure it would
    put a ``json.dumps`` of up to 10 MiB on the reader loop, which is the cost
    this module exists to avoid.

    *direction* is :data:`DIRECTION_IN` (the default; every reader-loop call)
    or :data:`DIRECTION_OUT` (the transports' stdin writers), and selects the
    file the frame lands in.
