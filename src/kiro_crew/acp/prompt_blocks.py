"""Build ACP ``session/prompt`` content blocks from a message and its attachments.

Channels hand the provider ONE string plus a STRUCTURED attachment list
(:class:`kiro_crew.prompt_attachments.PromptAttachment`). Every image block
this module emits comes from that list; the text is never scanned for image
paths. A path in the text is a mention -- the session ledger's
``artifact <name>: <path>.png`` snapshot line, a nudge body, an injected
envelope, an agent's own ``![shot](...png)`` reply quoted back, a consolidation
prompt -- and a mention must not become an upload: the backend replays every
stored image block, so one file re-inlined on every automation cycle grew the
request by its full encoded size per turn until the backend rejected the body.
Only the channel that received a file knows the user attached it, so only the
channel's list says so. This module owns the conversion so both prompt paths
share one implementation:

* :meth:`kiro_crew.acp.session_handle.AcpSessionHandle.prompt` -- the live path
  for the public Kiro backend (``AcpProvider.start`` swaps ``AcpClient`` out for
  ``AcpSessionProvider``, so this is what actually reaches kiro-cli).
* :meth:`kiro_crew.acp.client.AcpClient._send_prompt` -- the direct-client path.

Keeping one builder matters: both paths need the same list-to-image conversion,
so a single implementation stops any channel from shipping an attachment the
model never sees -- or one it was never given.

    image paths: a path that only appears in *message* is a mention, and stays
    text. For each inlined attachment the model is told what it was given by a
    ``[image: <name>]`` marker: the attachment's path is rewritten to the marker
    where the channel also wrote it into the text (Slack appends it as a bare
    line, the dashboard renders it as ``![image](path)``), and the marker is
    appended on its own line when the text never named it.

    ``allow_image=False`` (the agent did not advertise
    ``promptCapabilities.image``) emits no image block and leaves the text
    untouched: the file is still on disk and the channel's own path text still
    names it, so a tool-capable agent can open it, which is a strictly better
    fallback than dropping the reference. The result is always at least one
    text block, so a caller can pass it straight to ``session/prompt``.

    Inlined images are downscaled so their longest edge is at most
    ``max_image_edge`` px -- the server-side backstop for Anthropic's many-image
    dimension limit, applied for EVERY channel here regardless of any
    client-side resize that was skipped or bypassed -- and then shrunk further if

    * ``type_counts`` -- a count per block ``type`` (``text`` / ``image`` /
      ``tool_use`` / ``tool_result`` / ``other`` for any unrecognised or
      typeless shape).
    * ``empty_text_blocks`` -- text blocks whose ``text`` is missing, blank, or
      whitespace-only (a structurally suspicious payload). A text block with no
      ``text`` key at all is as suspect as one whose ``text`` is a blank
      string, so both fold into this count.
    * ``tool_use`` / ``tool_result`` -- the two tool-block counts surfaced at
      the top level so a pairing imbalance (a ``tool_result`` with no matching
      ``tool_use``, or vice versa) is visible at a glance.
    * ``total_bytes`` -- length of ``json.dumps`` of the NORMALISED block list
      (``[]`` when the argument is not a list or tuple), the approximate
      serialized wire size of the outbound request. Measuring the normalised
      list keeps the size coherent with the counts: a non-list argument reports
      ``block_count: 0`` alongside ``total_bytes: 2`` (an empty ``[]``) rather
      than a size describing a payload the counts claim is empty.

    This summary is deliberately safe to log: it carries no content and
    therefore cannot leak credentials or user data. That is a hard
    requirement -- the kiro-cli data dir is fenced precisely because it holds
    SSO tokens, so the outbound-request diagnostics must expose counts, types,
    and sizes ONLY, never the bytes themselves.

    Defensive by contract: this is a diagnostics helper on the live prompt
    path, so it never raises. A malformed ``blocks`` argument (not a list,
    ``None`` entries, non-dict entries, unserialisable content) yields a
    partial/minimal summary instead of propagating an exception into the turn.
