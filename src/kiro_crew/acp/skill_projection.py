    The single lease-liveness scan, which a prune calls exactly once rather than
    once per candidate: with a candidate cap and a lease-scan cap both in the
    thousands, a per-candidate scan multiplies into a quadratic sweep under the
    held publication lock. One bounded scan parses and lock-probes each lease a
    single time, unions the aliases named by every HELD lease into
    ``live_aliases``, and reports ``uncertain`` when it could not see the whole
    directory with confidence. Callers test membership in the returned
    ``live_aliases`` set for a single alias; there is no per-alias wrapper.

    Uncertainty is fail-closed: the caller authorizes NO candidate deletion when
    it is True, because a candidate whose covering lease the scan could not read
    must be treated as live. Held leases contribute to the union without
    short-circuiting, so the scan runs to the end and can still
    reclaim crash/finalizer residue after closure even when held leases exist.
    Residue is only ever unlinked AFTER the ``scandir`` context closes, never
    mid-iteration. A clean completion, a cap and an unreadable record all drain
    the residue they lock-validated before stopping, because each unlink is
    identity-checked on its own pair; a failed open or iteration of the directory
    itself trusts nothing it observed and discards the queued residue. A cap, an
    unreadable record and any error all answer uncertain, and the first two are
    logged at INFO with the count reclaimed. A spent
    :data:`_PROJECTION_LEASE_SCAN_MAX_SECONDS` deadline, checked between entries,
    is treated exactly like the cap. An unlocked ``.hold`` whose record
    is gone is reclaimed as residue too, so that litter cannot pin the ceiling.
    That orphan reclaim is limited to the writer's ``<pid>-<uuid4 hex>`` stem:
    an empty ``.hold`` carries no other proof that this module wrote it.

    cannot admit them and a reclaim keyed on ownership alone leaves the ENTIRE
    accumulated backlog on disk -- the exact per-turn tool-spec cost this module
    exists to bound. Those aliases are still identifiable without a record: the
    name is Crew's own prefix plus the 24-hex digest :func:`prepare_native_skill_projection`
    derives, and a projected view always renames itself to that alias and carries
    no ``skill://`` resource (both are what the projection strips and rewrites).

    Deleting one cannot prove the pair unregenerable the way a recorded work
    directory can, so the safety argument is the caller's instead: every consumer
    re-prepares first -- the spawn argv, and ``session/set_mode``, which re-runs
    preparation before it sends the alias -- and the `/agent` command is refused
    rather than translated. A removal is therefore a cache eviction for a live
    pre-upgrade session, which republishes the same name WITH a record, and a
    reclaim for every dead work directory.

    Name and shape alone are NOT provenance, and an unlink is not undoable: an
    operator's own agent could in principle carry this name. So one POSITIVE mark
    the projection itself writes is also required -- Crew's managed
    ``kirocrew-core`` server entry, or the absolute steering resource pointing at
    THIS host's kiro home -- both of which the shipped builds that produced the
    backlog already write. An unrecorded view carrying neither is left alone; it

    A read-only census for diagnostics, in this module so the lease-record and
    sidecar shapes it reads are the ones :func:`_prune_stale_managed_aliases`
    reclaims by. Returns plain counts:

    ``total``
        regular ``<prefix>*.json`` files directly in *directory*;
    ``leased``
        of those, how many a lease record names. The record is read with the
        reclaim's own parse and NO lock is probed -- a probe would reclaim
        residue as a side effect, which a census must not do -- so this is
        "published by some projection", not "held right now": a crash-stale
        record counts here until the next spawn's probe reclaims it;
    ``foreign_home`` / ``foreign_leased``
        of the unreferenced and of the lease-named aliases respectively, how
        many an ownership sidecar attributes to a Kiro Crew data home other
        than this process's own -- spelled exactly as the publisher records it,
        so a caller cannot pass a differently normalised id. Two homes share
        one agents directory whenever they share ``~/.kiro``, and this
        gateway's reclaim skips the other home's aliases unconditionally, so
        neither bucket drains here and the leased one is not "held or
        crash-stale" from this gateway's point of view either;
    ``unreadable_leases``
        lease records the reclaim reads as uncertainty. When one is unreadable,
        :func:`_scan_projection_leases` reports uncertainty for the pass and
        nothing is reclaimed, so a diagnostic must not promise a drain;
    ``truncated``
        1 when the alias retention bound (:data:`_CENSUS_MAX_ALIASES`) was hit,
        so the other counts are floors, or when the lease directory holds more
        entries than the reclaim scan's :data:`_PROJECTION_LEASE_SCAN_LIMIT` --
        counted over every entry, not just records -- so every prune would
        defer and no drain is promised.

    Every read failure counts toward the side that claims less: an unreadable
    directory is an empty census, an unreadable sidecar is not foreign.
