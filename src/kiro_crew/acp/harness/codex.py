"""The Codex ACP adapter: one Node process, N sessions, and its own confinement.

``@agentclientprotocol/codex-acp`` is a Node stdio server. It boots a single
``codex app-server`` child and translates ACP onto that server's operations. The
``codex`` CLI does not serve ACP itself -- it reads ``acp`` as a prompt -- so the
adapter is the transport, not an optimization.

**One process already hosts many sessions, which is why this harness exists.** The
adapter keeps ``this.sessions = new Map()`` and each ACP session id is a Codex
thread id on the one shared ``codex app-server`` child. N Crew sessions on one
adapter is therefore the adapter's own design, not something Crew layers on top.
:class:`~kiro_crew.acp.client.AcpClient` starts one adapter per session and pays N
Node processes and N app-servers for N sessions; ``AcpRuntime`` pays one.

**What a harness earns, and what it does not.** ``AcpProvider`` builds its own
``AcpRuntime`` per chat, so being runnable on the runtime does not by itself put two
chats on one process. Which hosts put a SUBAGENT's session on the parent's runtime is
``ACP_BACKENDS_SESSION_SHARING``, and codex is a member: a foreground chat still owns
its own runtime, and its subagents ride on that one rather than paying a Node process
and an app-server each.

Sharing here does not mean a session that outlives its parent. Teardown still sends
``session/close`` and the session still leaves the process -- a resident subagent
session would hold its own MCP fleet on a runtime nobody is using. What a later
``spawn_continue`` addresses is the thread ``codex`` persisted under ``CODEX_HOME``,
restored with ``session/load``; ``ACP_BACKENDS_HARNESS_OWNED_SESSIONS`` is the set
that says codex resolves such a load from the sessionId alone.

Eviction is a separate question with a separate answer, and the answer did not
change. The teardown Crew sends is ``session/close``, and it evicts: after it the
sessionId stops answering, so a session Crew drops actually leaves the process. That
is what admits codex to ``ACP_BACKENDS_SESSION_EVICTION``, and through it to every
path that creates and destroys sessions on a shared process -- the high-churn
background handles (``session._bg_runtime_backends``), warm pooled reuse, the
entitlement probe. One teardown verb answers for all of them, which is the point of
declaring it on the harness rather than gating each caller.

**One thing is global on a shared process, and a caller has to know it.**
``providers/set`` restarts the ``codex app-server`` child and then re-resumes every
thread on it. On a per-session adapter that is one user's session. Here it is EVERY
session on the process. Nothing in this module sends ``providers/set``, and nothing
should start sending it per session.

Codex is confined by Crew's sandbox and by nothing else
------------------------------------------------------
``ACP_BACKENDS_INTERNAL_SANDBOX`` does not name codex, so :attr:`internal_sandbox`
is False and Crew's own seatbelt/bubblewrap wrapper is the only OS confinement a
codex session gets. The Codex sandbox modes the adapter can apply are in-process
policy, not an OS sandbox Crew's could nest inside.

Crew's tool gate ENFORCES codex, so the spawn carries a credential mask on its
``SpawnPlan``. For an enforced host that mask is the only thing between a
third-party binary and the operator's credential homes: ACP cannot make such a host
ask about a passive read.

Two tiers hand back an UNWRAPPED child and drop that mask on the floor -- ``off``,
and a host with no sandbox backend where unsandboxed exec is opted in. An enforced
host that spawned there would run a third-party binary with the operator's credential
homes readable and nothing compensating for it, so :func:`resolve_spawn_masks`
REFUSES those tiers instead of returning an empty mask.

Permission routing is asserted per session, not seeded to a file
----------------------------------------------------------------
codex-acp's default ``agent`` mode writes inside the workspace without asking. Its
ACP v1 ``mode`` selector is the enforceable boundary, written over
``session/set_config_option`` -- ``Routing.SESSION_CONFIG`` in
``ACP_BACKEND_ROUTING``, which both drivers read for themselves. This harness
declares no routing member: a second copy of that table would be free to disagree
with the one that decides. There is no settings file to author first either, which
is why this harness has no ordering constraint the claude one has. ``read-only``
still permits passive READS; ACP v1 has no way to require a prompt for those, and
what makes the residual gap survivable is that mask.

The session array is the whole tool surface, and the adapter will not check it
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
codex reads no agent spec, so ``session/new``'s ``mcpServers`` is everything the
session will ever have. The adapter does not validate it: an element whose
transport it declared unsupported is ACCEPTED, and ``session/new`` returns a normal
sessionId. Captured live -- ``mcpCapabilities`` advertising ``sse: false``, an
``sse`` element sent anyway, session created; a control element typed
``nonsense-type`` created one too.

That failure mode is silence, which is why the narrowing matters. There is no error
for anyone to see and no frame to react to -- just a session running with a server
that was never wired, so a tool the operator declared is simply absent.
:meth:`CodexHarness.session_mcp_servers` is therefore the ONLY thing standing
between the array Crew composed and an array the adapter will honour, narrowed
against the capabilities THIS session's handshake reported.

Empty capabilities mean "nothing is known", never "nothing is supported": on a
handshake that advertised none, the array passes through untouched. Narrowing to
nothing there would strip every tool from every session.

The recycle ceiling is measured, and the scope is what it measures
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Seam 9 is overridden, because the runtime's default cannot express this host's
shape. The default ceiling is 500 MB over the adapter's whole descendant subtree,
which was chosen for kiro-cli, where the growth is in one child.

A codex process is three things, and only two of them are Crew's business. The
adapter is FLAT: 103 MB at zero sessions, 85 MB at eight -- it multiplexes without
growing. ``codex app-server`` grows gently and sub-linearly, +14 MB per session on
a minimal config and +37 MB with a host MCP registry. Together those two are the
core: 224 MB idle, and 522 MB at eight sessions in the worse of the two runs.

The third thing is a per-session fleet of MCP servers that ``codex`` starts from
its OWN configuration -- roughly 44 processes per session on a real host config,
none of it shared between sessions, and it appears even when Crew passes
``mcpServers: []``. That is 2751 MB at ONE session, 21551 MB at eight.

So the subtree total crosses 500 MB on the FIRST prompt of the FIRST session, on
both runs, and the default ceiling recycles a healthy process before it has served
a single turn. Raising the ceiling instead does not work either: the per-session
term is set by the user's own codex configuration, so any subtree number Crew
picks is either useless or arbitrary.

The scope is therefore the fix, and the ceiling follows from it: measure the core
(``rss_depth=1`` -- the adapter and its direct children) against 1024 MB, which
leaves real headroom over the measured 522 MB and still catches a genuine leak in
the part of the process Crew put there. The fleet is not ignored so much as
attributed: its size is a fact about the operator's codex config, and a ceiling is
not the instrument that governs it.

        a directory this child can write in.

        that found this did. Making ``~/.aws`` itself writable is the alternative
        and is refused: it means moving that path off the read-only copy primitive
        onto one that un-hides the real credential tree, which weakens the mask for
        every session to save one step in a wrapper's setup.

        * close again on the same id: ``{}`` again, so a double-terminate is safe;
        * a fresh ``session/new`` afterwards succeeds, so the process is unharmed.

        ``session/cancel``, on the same wire and the same oracle, leaves the session
        answering: it interrupts a turn, it does not end a session. A harness that
        sends it as its teardown does not belong in ``ACP_BACKENDS_SESSION_EVICTION``
        -- every path that creates and destroys a session on the shared process (the
        entitlement probe, warm pooled reuse, a refused routing write) leaves one
        resident under it. Sending the verb that
        evicts is what closes all of those at once.

        Evict, not delete, and the difference is what makes a codex subagent
        continuable. The Codex thread's own record survives under ``CODEX_HOME``, the
        same shape as kiro-cli's ``terminate`` leaving its transcript on disk --
        measured on the same run as the eviction above: a ``session/load`` on the
        CLOSED id succeeds, replays the conversation and then answers a question about
        the first turn, and it succeeds the same way from a RESTARTED adapter process
        over the same ``CODEX_HOME`` (330 input tokens against 9786 cached-read, so
        the context came from the thread and not from the prompt). That is what
        ``ACP_BACKENDS_SESSION_SHARING`` membership rests on, and why no keep-alive
        variant of this verb is needed: a shared subagent's session is closed at
        teardown like any other and its conversation is reached again by loading it.

        ``session/delete`` would ARCHIVE the thread -- measured too: a load afterwards
        refuses with ``session ... is archived``. So it is the verb a release means,
        never the verb dropping a session means, and sending it here would take the
        continuation away.

        **A REQUEST, and that is not cosmetic.** Measured on the same run: the
        adapter answers ``session/close`` with ``{}``, and sent as a NOTIFICATION it
        ignores it -- the session stays addressable exactly as it did under
        ``cancel``. So ``notification=False`` is load-bearing in the direction that
        looks like nothing is wrong: the notification form would log no error and
        leak every session. The runtime awaits this bounded by ``_TERMINATE_TIMEOUT``
        like the kiro family's verbs, and the adapter answers promptly, so the
        refusal path pays one round-trip rather than a budget.

        The gated test ``test_codex_session_mcp.py::test_real_codex_acp_session_close_evicts``
        repeats the measurement above on every install that has the adapter, so an
        adapter release that changes what ``close`` does goes red there rather than
        silently re-opening the leak.

        ``codex`` starts from the operator's own config, so a subtree ceiling
        recycles a healthy process on its first prompt, and no subtree number Crew
