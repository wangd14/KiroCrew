"""The backend-neutral harness contract ``AcpRuntime`` talks to.

A :class:`HarnessAdapter` is the answer to "what does this host do differently".
Each implementation answers every question in one file, so onboarding a host is
writing that file. The runtime reads answers rather than testing identities.

That matters because the questions are unrelated to each other and scattered
across the runtime's 3700 lines. An answer per host per question, all in one
place, is what makes the set enumerable: a host is complete when its file has no
abstract member left, and the base class supplies no defaults precisely so that
"complete" and "correct on every seam" are the same condition.

Three rules keep the layer honest.

**It re-declares no membership.** Every capability question resolves through the
``ACP_BACKENDS_*`` frozensets in :mod:`kiro_crew.agent_sdk.backends`, which stay
the single owner of who-can-do-what. A harness that hardcoded its own answer
would be a second copy to drift.

**It holds no runtime.** Everything a harness reads arrives as an argument --
:class:`SpawnContext` for the spawn, explicit keywords for the per-session
projection. Nothing here can reach back into the runtime's state, so a harness
cannot grow a hidden coupling that the next backend then has to reproduce.

**It decides, it does not act.** The runtime keeps ownership of the socket, the
process and the session table; the harness only says what to put in them.
