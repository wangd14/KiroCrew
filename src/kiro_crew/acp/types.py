METHOD_COMMANDS_EXECUTE = "_kiro.dev/commands/execute"
METHOD_SESSION_LOAD = "session/load"
#: The other standard restore verb, for an agent that keeps sessions but does not
#: implement full loading: it restores the session WITHOUT replaying the previous
#: messages. Its request and response carry the same fields as ``session/load``'s,
#: which is why one membership set (``ACP_BACKENDS_RESUME_WITHOUT_LOAD``) decides
#: which of the two a harness is sent rather than each having a restore path.
METHOD_SESSION_RESUME = "session/resume"
# kiro-cli extension: evict a session from the multiplexed process, freeing its
# transcript/context + reaping its MCP children. Without this the shared
# kiro-cli process retains every session's state for its whole lifetime, so RSS
# grows without bound as sessions accumulate. Handler: acp_agent.rs -> Session
# ManagerRequestData::TerminateSession (self.sessions.remove + handle.shutdown).
METHOD_SESSION_TERMINATE = "_kiro.dev/session/terminate"
#: KAS's equivalent. Its extension namespace is ``_kiro/`` (no ``.dev``), and it
#: has no evict-only verb: this disposes the resident session AND removes its
#: persisted record. Both are wanted here — the disposal is the memory reclaim
#: ``terminate`` exists for, and the record is what would otherwise accumulate.
#: Takes the same ``{"sessionId": ...}`` params and is idempotent.
METHOD_KAS_SESSION_DELETE = "_kiro/session/delete"
#: The STANDARD ACP evict verb, for a host that implements it. codex-acp does: it
#: drops the session from its local map and unsubscribes the Codex thread, so the
#: sessionId stops answering while the thread's own record survives on the Codex
#: side -- the same evict-not-delete shape as kiro-cli's ``terminate``. A REQUEST,
#: answered with ``{}``; sent as a notification the adapter ignores it and the
#: session stays resident, which is the leak this verb exists to close. Also
#: idempotent: closing an already-closed id answers ``{}`` again. Measured live
#: against codex-acp 1.11.0; the gated test
#: ``test_codex_session_mcp.py::test_real_codex_acp_session_close_evicts`` re-runs
#: that measurement on every install that has the adapter.

#: Appended to a session-start timeout's MCP progress when EVERY server the
#: session put on the wire has reported READY -- a roster member that reported
#: an init failure is named in the ``failed:`` bucket instead, and then the
#: stall may well be in it. The count before it covers only the session-injected
#: roster -- on kiro-cli the broker stubs Kiro Crew injects -- not the agent
#: spec's own servers and not the backend's session-start steps after MCP init;
#: without this note a complete count read as "MCP is up, so MCP is the
#: problem". The fraction already says every server reported, so the note adds
#: only the conclusion. One string for both start paths
#: (``AcpRuntime._mcp_init_progress`` and ``AcpClient._mcp_timeout_progress``)
#: so their messages cannot drift.

#: ``startOAuth`` true the engine keeps its OAuth callback listener open for the
#: whole connect attempt; the ``authorizationUrl`` on a failed ``_kiro/mcp/status``
#: entry comes from a passive attempt whose listener is already closed.

# here: codex-acp spells it ``reasoning_effort`` and claude-agent-acp spells it
# ``effort``, and a single constant beside ``MODEL_CONFIG_ID`` would read as one
# shared spelling and be written to the wrong adapter.

JSONRPC_METHOD_NOT_FOUND = -32601

# kiro-cli exposes its task/TODO list as an ordinary tool call whose real name
# arrives in `_meta.kiro.toolName` (the visible `title` is a prose sentence like
# "Creating task list: …", so it is NOT a reliable discriminator). Note this is
# NOT the ACP `plan` session update: kiro-cli 2.14.0 never emits `plan`, so
# UPDATE_PLAN below stays inert and the TODO list is recovered from this tool's
# rawOutput instead.
KIRO_TOOL_TODO_LIST = "todo_list"

# the browser on every reconnect, so it is bounded server-side.
TODO_TASKS_MAX = 200
# Per-task text cap — keeps one pathological entry from bloating every payload.
TODO_TEXT_MAX = 500
# Per-task id cap. kiro-cli numbers its tasks ("1", "2", ...), but the id is

# Capabilities we advertise during `initialize`.
#
# Nothing is advertised that has no inbound handler. Kiro Crew serves exactly one
# server-initiated request, `session/request_permission`; everything else reaches
# `_reject_unknown_server_request` and comes back `-32601 method not found`.
#
# `elicitation` was declared here as a forward-bet on kiro-cli routing an MCP
# server's `elicitation/create` out over ACP. It is withdrawn because the bet is
# not free, which is what the bet assumed. A client that sees the capability
# routes its human-in-the-loop prompts through `elicitation/create` INSTEAD of
# falling back to `session/request_permission` -- codex-acp gates exactly that
# way on `clientCapabilities.elicitation.form` -- so declaring a capability we do
# not serve does not sit inert waiting for a handler. It replaces a path that
# works with one that returns an error, and the client reads that error as a
# cancellation of the tool call the human was approving.
#
# So the declaration goes back to honest, and every affected client returns to the
# fallback that already works. Re-add the key in the same change that registers a
# handler for it, never before: `test_acp_client_capabilities.py` fails if the two
# drift apart again.
#
# `fs` and `terminal` stay false for the same reason, and always have: Kiro Crew
# does not serve the agent's file or terminal requests over ACP -- the agent uses
# its own tools for that, and advertising them would invite requests we have no
# handler for.

# ── ACP Backend Identifiers ──
# DEFINED in :mod:`kiro_crew.acp_backends` and re-exported from the import block
# at the top of this module, so ``from kiro_crew.acp.types import ACP_BACKEND_*``
# resolves here for its ~19 call sites.
#
# The definitions live outside this package: importing anything under
# ``kiro_crew.acp`` executes its ``__init__`` (client + runtime), so the loader's
# field metadata and the dashboard's PATCH allowlist cannot read them from here
# without dragging that in, and would each need a literal copy of the selectable
# list. ``acp_backends`` imports nothing from this package, so it can be the
# single code owner.
#
# The selectable set is not a constant either: it is a REGISTRY an edition
# extends (``register_selectable_backend``). A frozen ``ACP_BACKENDS_SELECTABLE``
# snapshot here would be read before boot registration and silently miss it.

# ── Capability membership ──
# The ``ACP_BACKENDS_*`` capability sets are DEFINED in the leaf module
# ``kiro_crew.acp_backends`` and re-exported by the import above, so
# ``from kiro_crew.acp.types import ACP_BACKENDS_STEER`` resolves. They live there
# for the same reason the backend identifiers do: a consumer outside this package
# must be able to ask a capability question without importing ``kiro_crew.acp``,
# whose ``__init__`` pulls in the client and runtime.

# ── Provider labels ──
# The backend identity key persisted in the session map. It indexes three
# things, so every producer must agree on it: resume compatibility
# (detect_provider_switch), session-map persistence, and session-file cleanup
# routing. Defined here rather than in providers.acp because session.py needs
# the vocabulary and cannot import that module at module scope.
#
# An absent label means kiro-cli, which is the default backend.

#: Backend id -> its label. The mapping is what ``provider_label`` resolves
#: through, so a harness's label and the answer a session persists under are one
#: fact rather than a constant here and a branch in ``providers.acp``. Closed on
#: purpose: an id absent from it persists as a kiro session, which is why
#: ``test_harness_parity`` asserts the keys are exactly ``ACP_BACKENDS_KNOWN``.
#:
#: kiro-cli's own id is the empty string and its label is the DEFAULT, so it is a
#: row here like every other harness rather than the value a missing row falls
#: back to -- the fallback exists for an id this build does not know at all.

# KAS reads only fs.readTextFile / fs.writeTextFile / terminal from the top

# client selects KAS feature flags; ``openExternalUrl`` is covered below.
#
# ``hooks`` stays undeclared although ``acp/kas_wire.py`` serves all three of its
# methods. Kiro Crew's own turn loop already fires every hook event this surface
# can serve for a KAS session, and its PreToolUse can BLOCK a tool on exit 2;
# announcing would run each hook twice and hand the agent a path whose output is
# only a context note.
#
# ``openExternalUrl`` is declared because it is the only channel an MCP OAuth
# consent URL reaches the client on: without it the engine has nowhere to send
# the link of a sign-in Crew starts with ``_kiro/mcp/resetServer``, and a remote
# OAuth server never connects. ``secretStorage`` stays undeclared, so the engine
# holds the resulting grant in memory and Crew never stores an MCP token. Every
# other callback stays undeclared (= false) too.

# share one vocabulary rather than duplicating string literals.

# adapter treats as "never call the host back at all", which would take a claude
# session out of the host gate entirely. Named so that value has one spelling
# here rather than a literal at each guard.
#
# It does NOT describe an inherited file. The settings writer is create-or-decline
# and never READS a file it did not author, so a ``bypassPermissions`` already
# sitting in a user's own ``settings.local.json`` (or in ``~/.claude``) is neither
# detected nor stripped -- that session's tool calls do not reach the host gate.
# That is the disclosed boundary recorded on ``_write_claude_local_settings``, not

# (see ``RefusalInfo``), so no consumer outside ``acp/`` ever compares against
# it; named here so the parser and its tests share one literal.
STOP_REASON_CONTENT_FILTERED_WIRE = "CONTENT_FILTERED"
# Signalled by the ACP layer when a genuinely-wedged (stale) turn was probed via
# session/cancel and got no ack within the grace window — a confirmed wedge, not

STOP_REASON_STALE_RECOVER = "stale_recover"

# and the backend then abandoned the turn (no prompt response, no
# end_turn) past the post-failure budget. Kept in the "error:" family so

# ── Stop-reason classes ──
#
# ``EVENT_COMPLETE`` only says a stream/turn ENDED; it is not proof the work
# succeeded. Every entry that consumes a completion (main chat, sub-agent run,
# nested child, task runner) maps the raw ``stop_reason`` onto ONE of these
# classes through :func:`classify_stop_reason`, so the terminal/wait state a
# task lands in cannot drift between entries. The classes are the task-level
# vocabulary of ``docs/system-specs/modules/subagent.md`` ("Stop reason →
# state"): ``succeeded`` is a normal end of turn; ``stalled`` and
# ``recovering`` are RECOVERABLE (bounded continue-nudge budget, then
# ``failed``); ``cancelled`` and ``failed`` are terminal.

#: both count against this same number, so a wedged turn is retried the same
#: number of times whichever surface it runs on. The number itself is the

        TrustDropdown's non-shell grant via ``approval_command``, the hook
        gate's app-own-server grant, and an ``auto_approve_tools`` pattern
        matched against ``@server/tool`` — the hook reports these with
        ``ToolHookResult.identity_grant``). Every matching path whose input the
        agent CAN author — the title, the payload's ``kind``, inline params,
        trust-reads over a command — stays gated on the composite
        ``child_low_fidelity``: a forged title must never satisfy them.

        Requirements, each fail-closed on its cache: a child origin
        (``sub_session_id``), no RESOLVED shell classification to the contrary
        (``not is_shell`` — a frame whose ``kind`` resolved to execute cached
        True, and its deny gates need the command bytes this event lacks; the
        kiro-cli transport identity must never waive that. The one exception
        is not a waiver but a different classification: codex-acp emits its
        MCP calls through its shell builder, so a frame carrying the
        adapter-authored ``_meta.is_mcp_tool_call`` marker is classified as
        MCP by ``_dispatch.classify_tool_call`` and never caches shell in the
        first place — its ``server``/``tool`` pair is what the adapter
        resolved, not model text), the canonical
        ``mcp_server_name`` + ``tool_name`` pair recovered from the tool_call
        cache (empty on a miss, and populated only for genuinely MCP-served
        tools — a host shell/builtin can never carry a server name), and the
        explicit ``mcp_identity_trusted`` provenance flag set by the trusted
        population sites — non-emptiness alone is NOT proof of provenance, so
        an identity pair written by any future inline/agent-authored fallback
        stays untrusted until that site earns the flag.

        ``shell_classified`` is deliberately NOT required: a backend may omit
        ``kind`` on its MCP tool_call frames, leaving the shell cache
        unwritten. The trusted transport identity is itself proof the call is
        MCP-served and therefore not a host shell command — but that proof
        stays confined to THIS identity-only property. Minting a resolved
        ``shell_classified`` from it instead would flip ``child_low_fidelity``
        to False and un-gate the content-matching auto-approve paths, letting
        a kindless mutating call with a read-looking, agent-authored title

# ── Structured status protocol (``kirocrew/status`` extension, version 1) ──

# ACP ``session/update`` carries tool-call start/complete and agent text;
# ``_kiro.dev/metadata`` carries the harness ``stopReason``; MCP
# ``notifications/progress`` is routed per request. None of them carries a WAIT
# REASON or a resume condition, so one versioned extension is added. It rides
# under ``params._meta[STATUS_EXTENSION_KEY]`` on a ``session/update`` frame and
# is TRUSTED ONLY FROM THE EXECUTION LAYER: the runtime accepts it from a frame
# routed to the session it names, never from a fanned-out frame and never from
# agent text (``AcpSessionHandle._handle_update`` enforces the origin rule; this
# module only owns the shape and the version gate). The MCP side — the same
# object under ``_meta.kirocrew_status`` on a ``notifications/progress``
# sibling — is documented in ``docs/system-specs/modules/acp-client.md`` and is
# NOT parsed here yet (the gateway stub is frozen for this PR).
