    """Return *root* if it is the declared tree AND staying inside the data home.

    THE chokepoint for component tree roots. Three separate sites touch them — the
    staging walk, the replace pass and the merge pass — and each was found to
    dereference a link independently, so the check lives here once.

    Two INDEPENDENT properties are required, and neither implies the other:

    **Containment** — the fully resolved path is a strict descendant of the resolved
    home. This answers "can a read or write through this root land outside the
    directory we are allowed to touch". Checking whether the node itself is a link
    does not answer it: a link nested under the root, or an ancestor of it, escapes
    while every individual node looks ordinary. ``Path.resolve()`` follows every link
    in the path, so the comparison covers roots, ancestors, descendants and Windows
    junctions at once. Equality with the home is refused, not allowed: a link like
    ``workspace/memory -> ..`` resolves to the home itself, which would make the
    "component tree" the whole home and sweep ``.env`` and ``sel_hmac.key`` into an
    archive meant to carry memory. No declared component tree is ever the home.

    **Identity** — no path segment from the home down to the root is a link. This
    answers a different question: "is this the tree the component declared". A link
    that redirects to another subtree INSIDE the home satisfies containment perfectly
    — ``workspace/memory -> ../apps`` resolves to a strict descendant — while
    silently changing WHICH data is archived. Because these bundles are uploaded, a
    redirect is an exfiltration primitive, not a mix-up: the archive would carry
    whatever the link points at under the name of the component that was asked for.
    Containment cannot see this, because nothing left the home.
