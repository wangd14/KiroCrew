"""Folds over ONE session's crew log -- the side panel's five views, and the ledger.

The panel reads five, and those five are what the growth push carries. ``class`` is a
sixth registered fold that is deliberately NOT advertised: its reader is
a session deciding whether it may read ANOTHER unit's log, which is why it is held at
the most restrictive value the log ever recorded rather than at the current one.

A projection folds one crew log and carries that log's ``seq`` as its version
(RFC FR-5), so a reader that holds a projection at seq N and reads the entries
after N reaches the same value a reader folding the whole file from scratch
does. That equality is the module's contract and the property its tests pin.

The INCREMENTAL form is the primitive here and the whole-file form wraps it. A
fold is three pure pieces -- a starting state, one step per entry, and a render
-- and :func:`fold` is those pieces run over every entry. A separate batch
implementation would be a second codepath that can disagree with the resumed
one about the same bytes, and nothing in the file would say which is right.

State is JSON-serializable and is the CHECKPOINT: a caller may store it, hand it
back later with the seq it was taken at, and continue. It is deliberately not
the rendered value. A fold keeps bookkeeping a reader has no use for (the open
tool calls it is matching by ``call_id``, the attempt an open turn is on), and
:func:`Checkpoint.state` holding exactly what the fold needs to continue is what
lets the render stay the surface the dashboard reads.
:mod:`kiro_crew.crew_log.checkpoint` writes that state beside the log, so a read
resumes where the last one stopped; this module owns no path and every failure
over there is answered by folding from seq 1 again.

Absent is never read as zero. ``turn/completed`` carries ``credits`` and
``tokens`` only on a provider-reported close, so a synthesized closer omits them
-- and a total that counted those turns as costing nothing would state a
measurement nobody made. Each total therefore rides beside the count of turns
that contributed to it, and a caller comparing the two learns what the total
covers.

Nothing here synthesizes history. An interrupted turn and an unmatched tool call
are reported as OPEN, never closed with an invented outcome: closing them is the
store's ``repair=True``, which appends real deterministic closers under write
ownership, and a reader inventing the same fact in memory would make two readers
of one file disagree.

This module reads its own unit's file and nothing else (FR-4: no fold reads more
than its own crew log) -- with ONE stated exception, and it is stated because a
reader has to know which kind of fold it is holding. The ``ledger`` fold is keyed
by SLOT, and a slot owns one ACP session id at a time rather than for its whole
life, so the record it answers for is spread over a unit per id the slot ran
under. It therefore joins those units (:func:`fold_slot`), which is a wider read
than the five panel folds make and is why it is not one of them: the growth push
and the side panel address a session, and a slot-wide value pushed under one
session's id would report a partial answer as the whole one. The units it joins
are still exactly one slot's own, so nothing here reads across slots.

Resolving a ``ref`` is the PAGE path's work, in the routes that serve a person a
citation to follow.

#: and are driven by :func:`fold_slot_checkpoint`, which joins several files.
SESSION_FOLD_NAMES: Final[tuple[str, ...]] = PROJECTION_NAMES + INTERNAL_PROJECTION_NAMES

#: Projections keyed by a SLOT instead of by one crew log. A slot owns one ACP

#: its work ledger -- is spread over a unit per id it ran under, and answering for
#: it means joining them (:func:`fold_slot`). Kept out of
#: :data:`PROJECTION_NAMES` for that reason: the growth push and the side panel
#: address a session, and pushing a slot-wide value under one session's id would
#: report a partial answer as the whole one.
SLOT_PROJECTION_NAMES: Final[tuple[str, ...]] = ("ledger", "radar", "work", "panel")

#: The slot-keyed fold served by its OWNER and by no generic route. This fold's owner
#: (the Issue Radar crew store) orders a crew's units by the order the crew recorded
#: into them and pins the live unit last; a generic read has neither fact, and a
#: per-unit read would serve a part of the record as the whole. The dashboard's
#: projection routes refuse this name the way they refuse an unregistered one.
OWNER_SERVED_SLOT_PROJECTION: Final[str] = "radar"

#: Every fold this module registers, in registry order.
FOLD_NAMES: Final[tuple[str, ...]] = (
    PROJECTION_NAMES + INTERNAL_PROJECTION_NAMES + SLOT_PROJECTION_NAMES
)

#: The SHAPE of what these folds store, which is what a savepoint holds. It lives
#: here because it describes ``start`` and ``step``, and those are here: the
#: projection kernel reads it off each definition
#: (:class:`~kiro_crew.projection.ProjectionDefinition`) and refuses a payload
#: written under another number, so a stored state cannot resume onto logic that
#: keeps different bookkeeping.
#:
#: THE RULE: any change to what a fold's ``start`` or ``step`` STORES moves that
#: FOLD's version, including one that keeps the same keys. Shape is all this number
#: and ``_state_matches_fold`` can check, so a counting fix that leaves the keys
#: alone would resume the old build's state onto the new logic -- and the long
#: sessions a savepoint speeds up are the ones that then serve pre-fix numbers for the
#: life of the unit. Moving it retires that fold's savepoints to a cold fold, which
#: costs one refold each and is the only in-product way to retire them, since the tree
#: is fenced from the agent.
#: ``test_changing_what_a_fold_stores_forces_the_savepoint_version_to_move`` pins each
#: fold's stored state against its own version, so forgetting the move fails CI rather
#: than shipping.
#:
#: THE NUMBER IS PER FOLD (:attr:`_Fold.state_version`), and this is the value a fold
#: that has never moved still stands at. A savepoint file records the version of the
#: fold it holds, so a bump retires THAT fold's files and leaves every other fold's
#: standing -- where one shared number retired all six for a change to one of them,
#: and the sessions paying for it were the long ones the savepoints exist for.
_FOLD_STATE_VERSION_BASE: Final[int] = 4

#: The types these folds can interpret, handed to ``iter_from(known=...)`` so an
#: entry from a newer writer stops the fold instead of skewing it. The set is the
#: DECLARED session vocabulary rather than the types these folds branch on: a
#: declared type this module ignores is a fact it chose not to use, while an
#: undeclared one is a fact it does not know exists, and only the second can
#: change what the entries after it mean.
KNOWN_TYPES: Final[frozenset[str]] = frozenset(SESSION_ENTRY_TYPES)

#: Newest moments a ``timeline`` keeps. A projection is pushed over a socket on
#: every growth, so its value is bounded by construction rather than by how long
#: the session ran; the count of moments dropped off the front is kept, so a
#: reader is told the list is a window rather than the whole history.
TIMELINE_LIMIT: Final[int] = 200

#: Newest per-turn context rows a ``usage`` projection keeps, the same posture and
#: the same value as :data:`TIMELINE_LIMIT`: this is the second window this module
#: holds, and a projection is pushed over a socket on every growth, so its size is
#: bounded by construction rather than by how long the session ran. No count of what
#: fell off the front rides beside it: every retained row carries its own ``ordinal``,
#: assigned before any truncation, so a reader reads the first row's true position and
#: knows exactly how much precedes it. A whole-session drop total could not answer
#: that for a reader bounded to a narrower window, which is what made it a defect.
#:
#: Measured at the WORST CASE rather than reasoned about, since this is the fold's
#: largest new state: 200 rows each holding :data:`CONTEXT_SOURCES_PER_TURN_LIMIT`
#: sources whose labels sit at :data:`TEXT_LIMIT` is 808,912 bytes of Python objects.
#: ``test_a_full_context_window_stays_under_the_slot_fold_cell_budget`` re-measures
#: that same worst case, so the figure fails rather than rots -- and it measures the
#: CAP, not a realistic row, because a realistic 40-source row is 511,192 and would
#: leave the real ceiling untested.
#:
#: It matters because this fold is read per SLOT, so its state lands in the slot-fold
#: cache, whose own ceiling is stated against its largest member -- ``radar`` at
#: 995,342 bytes. A full window here fits under that with 186,430 bytes to spare.
#: The row shape is what buys that: the entry's own list of three-key dicts measures
#: 3,319,357 at the same worst case and would breach the ceiling by 2.3 MB. See
#: ``row_sources`` in ``_usage_step``.
CONTEXT_TURNS_LIMIT: Final[int] = 200

#: Sources one retained context row details. The label vocabulary
#: (``context_blocks.split_blocks``) is fixed and far under this, so the cap is what
#: keeps a row bounded against a NEWER writer's longer vocabulary rather than a limit
#: today's writer reaches. Past it the row's own ``chars`` total stays as recorded, so
#: a truncated source list is never mistaken for a smaller prompt, and the session-wide
#: ``by_source`` breakdown counts every source regardless -- it is keyed by label and so
#: is not subject to this per-row cap.
CONTEXT_SOURCES_PER_TURN_LIMIT: Final[int] = 64

#: Distinct tool names a ``tools`` projection details. Past it the totals stay
#: exact and ``names_omitted`` counts the names left out.
TOOL_NAME_LIMIT: Final[int] = 100

#: Distinct models a ``usage`` projection details per model. Past it the whole-
#: session totals stay exact and ``models_omitted`` counts the models left out,
#: the same posture as ``TOOL_NAME_LIMIT``. A turn carries a model string, so an
#: unbounded ``by_model`` would grow the checkpoint over a long session.
MODEL_LIMIT: Final[int] = 100

#: Open tool calls and pending approvals listed individually.
OPEN_LIST_LIMIT: Final[int] = 50

#: Open tool calls and pending approvals RETAINED in the fold state. The render
#: lists ``OPEN_LIST_LIMIT`` of them, but the state kept every id it had not yet
#: matched, so a session that leaked unmatched calls or approvals grew the
#: checkpoint without bound -- the one thing this module says it never does. Past
#: this cap a further distinct id is COUNTED as omitted and not retained, so the
#: state stays bounded and a later completion for a dropped id reads as unmatched
#: rather than reopening unbounded growth. Set above the render cap so the listed
#: window is always drawn from retained entries.
OPEN_RETAIN_LIMIT: Final[int] = 512

#: Distinct MCP servers a single tool row records. A tool called through many
#: servers would otherwise append every distinct name to its row without bound.
SERVERS_PER_TOOL_LIMIT: Final[int] = 32

#: Characters of any retained LABEL -- a tool or model name, a server, an
#: approval's tool or reason, a decision. Capping the COUNT of retained values
#: bounds nothing on its own: every one of these strings comes off the wire, and
#: a handful of near-64-KiB ones dwarf the budget they are counted against. A
#: label is a display value, so the honest bound is to keep its head and let the
#: tail go.
TEXT_LIMIT: Final[int] = 200

#: Characters of a retained IDENTITY -- a tool ``call_id``, an ``approval_id``.
#: These are NOT truncated like a label: two distinct ids sharing a 200-character
#: head would become one identity, and one completion would then close a
#: different call's frame. Past this length an id identifies NOTHING, exactly like
#: an absent one, and is counted and left unpaired.
ID_LIMIT: Final[int] = 200

#: The token dimensions ``turn/completed`` bills, in the order it declares them.
TOKEN_DIMENSIONS: Final[tuple[str, ...]] = ("input", "output", "cache_read", "cache_write")

#: Types a ``timeline`` records. Turn, lifecycle and cost boundaries -- the
#: moments a person scanning a session looks for. Message, step and tool entries
#: are deliberately absent: they are the bulk of a log, they are what the page
#: route and the ``tools`` projection already serve, and a timeline that included
#: them would be a second copy of the file rather than a summary of it.

    ``bind_slot`` is the fourth piece a SLOT-keyed fold has: the reader knows
    which slot it is folding and says so before the first entry, so the fold
    never has to infer its board from whichever entry happens to come first.

    ``affects`` and ``copy_state`` are what let a MUTATING ``step`` serve as the
    projection kernel's pure ``apply`` (:class:`_SessionFold`). ``step`` edits the
    dict it is handed, and the kernel requires a new object on a real change and the
    SAME object on none -- so ``apply`` copies first and steps the copy, and skips
    both when the entry cannot touch this fold.

    ``affects`` is the set of entry types whose ``step`` can change this fold's
    state, or ``None`` for a fold every entry moves. It may be WIDER than the truth
    and must never be narrower: a type wrongly included costs a copy and, for a
    client watching the change feed, one frame for an entry that changed nothing,
    while a type wrongly left out drops a real change and serves a stale value with
    nothing raised.

    ``copy_state`` must copy every container ``step`` can reach, transitively --
    ``None`` falls back to a deep copy, which is always correct and pays for the
    whole state. A shallower copy is what makes the per-entry cost bounded, and
    ``test_a_fold_never_reaches_into_the_state_it_was_handed`` is what keeps it
    honest: a nested container left shared shows up there as the prior state moving.

    ``state_version`` is the version of what THIS fold stores, and it is the number
    its savepoint files carry. It is per fold so that retiring one fold's stored
    meaning costs a cold fold to that fold alone -- see
    :data:`_FOLD_STATE_VERSION_BASE` for the rule that moves it.

    ``mode`` decides WHEN the fold runs. ``"lazy"`` is the original posture: the value
    is folded when a reader asks for it. ``"eager"`` folds it off the append path
    instead, so a reader is served a value that was already current
    (:mod:`kiro_crew.crew_log.eager`). An eager fold must declare ``affects``: the worker
    wakes on the entry types its folds name, and a fold every entry moves would wake it
    for every message body in the log -- the exact cost the mode exists to remove from
    the read. That is checked here, at import, because a registry the process cannot

    A reuse (:func:`fold_session` ``since=``) folds new bytes onto a cached
    checkpoint only when the file it folds now is the SAME one the checkpoint
    came from. The identity combines three signals so no single one has to be
    unique on its own: the header's ``created_at`` (stamped once at create, so a
    recreated log under the same id gets a fresh value), and the file's device
    and inode (which differ when a freed inode is NOT reused, and, combined with
    ``created_at``, make a same-millisecond recreation onto a recycled inode the
    only colliding case -- itself near-impossible). This catches what the seq
    guard cannot: a recreated log that has already grown PAST the cached seq.
    ``None`` is "unknown identity" and never matches, so a header without the
    field or a stat failure falls back to the safe full rebuild. Size and mtime
    together also prevent a same-size in-place rewrite from taking the unchanged
    fast path. A successful stat still returns both when the header lacks
    ``created_at``.

    BOTH identity signals are read from the file on disk on every call, and
    neither comes from *handle*'s own parsed header. That header was parsed when
    the handle was opened, so it keeps answering for the file that existed then --
    which would leave this comparing device and inode alone across exactly the
    recreation it exists to catch, and a just-freed inode is commonly handed
    straight back.

    The size and mtime cover EVERY segment the walk would read, not only the
    newest one that ``handle.path`` names: size is the sum and mtime the newest
    across the segment set, with the count folded into the sum so a whole
    segment appearing or vanishing (rotation, retention) can never cancel out
    against another's growth. The fingerprint must cover exactly what the walk
    consumes -- a fingerprint narrower than the walk is how each round of this
    guard's history got the same finding back in a new spelling -- and it stays
    stat-only, because reading file contents per poll is the cost the fast path
    exists to avoid. A segment vanishing between the listing and its stat is a
    file set in motion, and reads as "unknown": the fold then walks, which is

    The header fallthrough orders units by ``createdAt``, a wall-clock stamp: a clock

    resume -- sorts the genuinely-newer unit BEFORE its predecessor. The usage fold
    appends each ``context/composed`` as a per-turn row and trims the OLDEST off the

    The predecessor link is read O(1) from each unit's opening entry, and there are as
    many reads as the slot has units, which is small. A unit whose predecessor cannot be
    read is a chain start (depth 0), the safe direction -- it starts its own chain rather

    Depth alone is NOT the whole order, because a slot can hold two UNRELATED chains at

    would sort adjacent, splitting each chain's ``previous_sid`` edges apart and landing
    a retired chain's rows between a live chain's. So the order is chain-CONTIGUOUS: each
    unit is grouped under its chain root (the deepest predecessor still in the
    population), the roots -- the only units the chain cannot relate -- are ordered by
    their ``createdAt`` header, and within a chain the ``previous_sid`` depth leads. That

    seqs continuing from the cut, and a failed append is truncated back after its bytes
    reached the disk -- and a reader holds no append lock while either runs. Both leave
    a file that has grown since the last read and reuses seqs the fold already consumed,
    which is a pure append to every stat and to every seq comparison. The digest is
    decode-free, so it costs a byte walk of one unit against the parse-and-fold walk of
    every unit that a cold read would pay.

    THE INVARIANT: the heights sampled before a pass reads are its READ PLAN, never the
    cell's claim about itself. What a memo remembers is what the pass actually FOLDED
    (:func:`_folded_marks`). Two things follow. An append landing mid-read is folded in
    and the next read starts above it, so it is neither dropped nor counted twice. And a
    slot that has not moved compares equal and is answered from the cell -- where a memo
    holding the sample would sit permanently one entry short of itself and send every
    later read back to the file for a tail it has already folded.

    In memory rather than on disk, per process, and best-effort by contract: a second
    process folds cold, and so does the first after an eviction. What must never happen
    is a WRONG answer, so every condition :func:`_continuable` does not admit refolds
    from empty rather than carrying state that describes other bytes.

#
# A session fold's ``step`` mutates the dict it is handed, and the projection kernel
# drives a pure ``apply`` (:class:`_SessionFold`), so each fold declares two things
# the wrapper needs. They are declared TOGETHER rather than beside their own folds
# because they are read against each other: the question a reviewer asks is whether
# one fold's copier covers every container its step reaches, and the answer is easier
# to see with the six side by side than scattered through two thousand lines.
#
# A copier covers the containers a step MUTATES, not every container in the state. A
# value the step only ever REPLACES whole -- ``status``'s ``open_turn``, ``approvals``'
# ``last``, a frame put into ``open`` or ``pending`` -- needs no copy of its own: the
# old object is dropped rather than edited, so the state it came from keeps it intact.
