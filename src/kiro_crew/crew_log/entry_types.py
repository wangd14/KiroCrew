"""Per-type ``data`` shapes for the session crew log entry types, checked on append.

:data:`TYPE_OWNERSHIP` answers whether a KIND of unit has such events at all, by
domain prefix. This module answers the next question -- what does one entry of
this type carry -- and it is the single machine-readable source for it. The shape
of a ``data`` payload is otherwise stated twice, in the emitter that builds it and
in a spec table describing it, and two statements of one fact drift.

**What a declaration is derived from.** The WRITER, not the table: every field
below is read off the site that produces it (:mod:`kiro_crew.crew_log.emit`
for the ordinary entries, ``store._closer_entries`` for the crash-repair closers).
A type earns a declaration by having a writer, so the types declared here are
exactly the types something writes today, whether or not the writer marks the
entry ignorable. An ignorable write is not exempt: a folding reader SKIPS an
undeclared ignorable entry, a skip is a gap in the sequence the fold receives, and
the class fold reads a gap as damage. So ``plan/updated`` is declared like the
rest, and its write keeps ``ignorable=True`` untouched. A type nothing writes at
all is left undeclared, which is the posture ``message/steered`` already gets.
``test_crew_log_types`` pins the two sets equal in both directions -- every
declared type has a producing site, and every type a writer appends is declared.
A field
is ``required`` only when EVERY writer of that type produces it, which is why a few
fields the spec table marks required are optional here -- the repair closer knows
the turn and the reason and nothing else, and a required field it cannot supply
would refuse the one write that closes an interrupted turn.

**A missing declaration is not a passive gap.** A reader that FOLDS state passes
``known=`` to :meth:`~kiro_crew.crew_log.store.CrewLog.iter_from`, which refuses an
entry whose type it does not know and which is not marked ignorable -- so a type
written without a declaration does not merely go uninterpreted, it stops every
later fold of that log permanently. Declaring a type is therefore what makes a log
containing it readable at all, and it is independent of whether any fold branches
on it: a declared type a fold ignores is a fact it chose not to use, while an
undeclared one is a fact it does not know exists.

**Undeclared keys are refused**, the same posture and for the same reason as
:func:`~kiro_crew.crew_log.schema.build_header`: a caller that misspells a field
would otherwise be told the entry landed as asked while the value it meant to
record silently vanished. So a new field arrives with its declaration, in one
commit, or not at all.

**Values come in two strengths, and only one of them refuses.** ``enum_closed``
marks a vocabulary the WRITER itself clamps -- ``turn/started.actor`` and
``turn/refused.actor`` are coerced to
:data:`~kiro_crew.crew_log.emit.ACTORS` at the emitter -- so no caller can
produce a value outside it and enforcing costs nothing. Every other vocabulary is
PASSED THROUGH from
somewhere this module does not own: a provider's ``stop_reason``, the gateway's
own ``end_reason``, a provider's tool ``status``, a subagent runtime's outcome.
Those are recorded as ``enum`` for the reference tables and are NOT enforced,
because enforcing them converts "the upstream vocabulary grew" into "the entry is
refused and counted as a write loss" -- the registry would then destroy records
instead of catching mistakes.

Types with no declaration pass through untouched. Two kinds are declared here --
the session families and the crew kind's two dispatch contracts -- and everything
else is left open on purpose: the crew kind's other six domains, the member
kind's whole vocabulary (owned by the member event log), and every guest
namespace (``app:<name>/…``) are writable without a registry entry.

#: crew then reads the record its OWN ownership digest keys, instead of a newer
#: crew's publish hiding an older one's panel from its own drawer.
#:
#: Small because the number is not a scale: one slug is one member, and a collision
