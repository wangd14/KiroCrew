    THREADING CONTRACT
    ------------------
    Every mutation rewrites the WHOLE map from ``_data``, so a read-modify-write
    is only atomic if nothing else touches the structure in between. Three rules
    hold that together; the first two are enforced, the third cannot be:

    1. **Any thread may call this class.** :data:`_MAP_LOCK` (module-level,
       reentrant) guards every method that mutates the map, iterates it, or
       reads several fields as one unit. Single-key probes (``get_cwd``,
       ``get_flag``, ``get_session_for_thread``, …) are lock-free on purpose:
       one ``dict.get`` cannot observe a half-applied write, and taking the lock
       for them would put the map's cheapest reads — including the one on every
       inbound Slack reply — behind its most expensive write. What that costs is
       a rule for the WRITERS: a structure a lock-free reader looks at is
       replaced by rebinding a finished copy, never cleared and refilled in
       place (see :meth:`_rebuild_thread_index`).

       Because a caller can now WAIT, what may be held under the lock is
       bounded: **no guarded method reads or parses the map file.** The longest
       hold is one whole-map write (0.77 ms at today's size) plus, in ``get`` and
       ``prune``, a session-file stat per entry — costs the event loop already
       paid inline before this lock existed. Loading a file into a fresh
       instance is the one unbounded step, and :meth:`_load` is deliberately
       unguarded so a worker-thread construction cannot stall the loop behind
       its disk read.

    2. **A multi-mutation sequence must say so.** Two locked calls are two
       critical sections, and another thread's write can land between them and
       be lost by the second one's whole-map rewrite. :meth:`batched_save` holds
       the lock across the block, making the sequence one critical section AND
       one write. Related mutations belong inside it — never merely adjacent.
       It MUST NOT be held across an ``await``: the lock is per-thread
       reentrant, so an await inside a batch lets another coroutine on the same
       loop walk straight into the block, while a worker thread waiting on the
       lock stalls until the await returns. ``test_session_map_locking.py``
       ratchets this against the whole tree.

    3. **Writes go through the LIVE map.** The lock orders access to the
       structure; it cannot reconcile two instances that loaded ``_data``
       independently, because the loser's rewrite is a whole-file write of a
       stale snapshot. A throwaway ``SessionMap()`` is therefore READ-ONLY —
       see ``session_transfer._join_layer_b`` for what a detached write costs.

    On the event loop, a mutation does not pay the disk write inline: it marks
    the map dirty and a debounced flush task serializes UNDER the lock into an
    immutable payload, then writes tmp+rename in a worker thread — ``_data``
    never crosses the thread boundary, and the lock is never held across the
    await (the ratchet in ``test_session_map_locking.py`` checks that). Off the
    loop (CLI, tests, worker threads) writes stay inline and synchronous.
    :meth:`flush` (sync) and :meth:`aflush` (awaited) are the deterministic
    durability points; losing a pending flush leaves a well-formed OLDER file,
    never a truncated one. The lock is what
    makes the offload safe at all — before it, offloading a single write made
    the map racy instead of non-blocking.

    SCOPE: the lock is in-PROCESS. Two gateways writing one map file would still
    lose updates, and nothing here changes that — the data-home singleton is what
    keeps that from happening. ``history.ConversationLog._locked`` is the
    cross-process, off-loop-enforcing primitive; this is deliberately not it.

        so it is safe on the event loop and carries no cross-thread hazard.

        It answers a question :meth:`get` deliberately does not. ``get`` asks
        "can this ID still be resumed", which is why it stats the transcript and
        PRUNES the entry when that file is gone or empty. A caller recording
        HISTORY wants the opposite: the ID this key was last serving, whether or
        not a resume would now succeed. Routing such a caller through ``get``
        loses the ID exactly when the two stores disagree -- a crew log unit can
        outlive a truncated ACP transcript -- and mutates the map as a side
        effect of being asked to describe it.

        So this is not an alternative spelling of ``get``: a caller deciding
        whether to RESUME must still use ``get``, whose file check is the whole
        point, and must not treat a value from here as a resumable session.

        :func:`_stash_and_clear_sid`: the provider switch, the poisoned
        conversation discard, and the two stale paths whose transcript went
        missing. For the resume question an emptied sid IS the answer, which is
        why ``get`` must not see the stash. For the history question it is not:
        the emptied id is exactly "the ID this key was last serving", so reading
        ``sid`` alone would report a key that has served a session all day as
        having served none, and a successor would cite no predecessor at all.
        Recording it on only some of those paths is worse than recording it on
        none, because the field then holds a genuine id that is not the latest
        one, and a successor cites a predecessor two links back.

        :func:`_keeps_entry` is the single predicate both stale branches ask,
        so neither can start discarding what the other keeps. A durable flag is a
        per-conversation SETTING, not session state: it can be written before the
        conversation has ever run a turn (``/unlink`` as the very first message
        leaves no ``sid``, no thread and no mirror), and it must outlive the
        native session the conversation happened to be using. A channel binding
        (``slack_thread_ts``, ``mirror``) is the conversation's identity: it is
        what routes an inbound channel message back to this session. Deleting the
        entry either way would silently revert user state at the next restart —
        the setting returns to the default they had just turned off, or the next
        message from the channel opens a fresh session instead of resuming the
        one it is bound to.

        A privacy-mode flag (a temporary or incognito thread) keeps its entry here
        too, and nothing else removes it either: the flag is the record the
        channel's inbound gate hydrates from, so the row stays until that gate
        can read the transcript header instead (:func:`_keeps_entry`, and the
        module comment above ``_PRIVACY_STRICTNESS``). What this loop-side,
        lock-held method must NOT do for such a row is read its transcript;
        ensuring the header records the mode is disk I/O, and
        :meth:`stamp_privacy_headers`, awaited right after this on the startup
        path, does it on a worker thread.

        Returns the number of entries removed; a ``sid``-only reset is a repair,

        Collection goes through :meth:`_remove_entry` rather than deleting out of

        :func:`_survives_prune` holds every bound entry back -- and reaching the
        choke point anyway is the point: a future loosening of that predicate then
        lands on an audited path instead of silently collecting a live binding. On
        prune's only production path (``start_pool``, on the startup loop) the
        per-entry saves coalesce through ``_save``'s debounced deferred flush into

        ``header_before`` and restores to it, so the thread's consolidation

        arguments: a backstop whose idea of "occupied" differs from the precheck
        it backs looks like coverage while diverging from it in exactly the cases
        that matter.

        Exclusivity is owed to INBOUND routing, so it is scoped to it. A
        conversation is exclusive when it is inbound-committed — either this claim
        is inbound-capable, or an existing occupant already is. That is precisely
        when a second binding does harm: the inbound resolver refuses to choose
        between two candidates and returns ``None``, and "no owner" and "two
        owners" are the same ``None`` to it, so the reply silently starts a fresh
        session instead of resuming.

        Two outbound-only mirrors on one conversation are left alone. They are
        merely noisy — both write out, nobody reads back — and refusing them
        would reach transports that cannot resume at all, whose in-channel link
        handlers do not translate this refusal because they can never provoke it.

        The occupancy scan itself is UNFILTERED once the conversation is
        inbound-committed: an outbound-only occupant counts. Narrowing that too
        would let an in-channel ``!link`` land a second binding on a conversation
        the dashboard is resuming through, which is the collision that strands the
        reply.

        A rebind by the SAME session is not a rivalry, and three spellings can all
        mean "me": the canonical key, the row the binding actually lives on today
        (a pre-unification ``dashboard:`` row, which only ``_mirror_key`` can
        identify), and any other spelling that canonicalizes to this key. Deriving
        the legacy name unconditionally instead of asking ``_mirror_key`` would
        excuse a row that is NOT this session's binding, letting a genuine
        duplicate persist.

        CONTRACT FOR A NEW TRANSPORT: declaring
        ``TransportCapabilities.supports_session_resume`` makes its conversations
        inbound-committable, and therefore makes this refusal reachable from that
        transport's own in-channel link handler. Translate it there into a
        followable message, as ``discord/transport_dispatch.py`` does — an uncaught
