# Monitor a pull request

Use a pull-request monitor when you want Kiro Crew to keep checking a GitHub,
GitLab, Azure DevOps, or Bitbucket Cloud pull request without spending a model
turn on every poll. Kiro Crew wakes the owning conversation only when a new
revision needs action.

## Before you start

A structured monitor supports GitHub pull requests, GitLab merge requests,
Azure DevOps Services pull requests, and Bitbucket Cloud pull requests for the
`review_ready` objective. Self-managed GitLab hosts must be present in the
operator's `dashboard.gitlab_hosts` allowlist; Azure DevOps Server and Bitbucket
Data Center are not supported. Start the monitor from a dashboard, Slack, or
Discord conversation.

Channel-bound GitHub and GitLab monitors retain the existing authenticated `gh`
and host-authorized `glab` behavior. They do not use the operator's protected
Azure or Bitbucket credentials: Bitbucket Cloud can monitor a public pull request
anonymously from a channel, while private Bitbucket pull requests and Azure DevOps
pull requests that need operator authentication must be started from a dashboard
conversation.

Use a finite legacy loop instead when the decision depends on generic comments,
advisory findings, another forge, a deployment, a ticket, or a custom objective.

## Start the monitor

1. Open the conversation that should own the watch.
2. Ask Kiro Crew to monitor the full pull-request URL until it is review-ready.
3. End the turn after the tool reports that application is pending.
4. Confirm the active monitor in the dashboard.

The tool reply is an application request, not proof that the monitor started.
The owning session applies it only after the turn ends. At the start of a later
user turn or monitor wake, the agent can call `monitor_inspect` to read the
authoritative retained state.

Unless you choose different limits, the monitor uses:

| Limit | Default |
|---|---:|
| Probe interval | 5 minutes |
| Runtime | 4 hours |
| Completed agent turns | Unlimited (0) |
| Reported aggregate input and output tokens | 250,000 |
| Consecutive provider errors | 3 |

The token cap applies only to usage reported by the model provider.
`token_usage_known` tells you whether every completed turn included usage. The
runtime limit is the hard fallback when usage is unknown; it always applies. The
completed-turn limit is a fallback only when it is a positive number -- pass 0
to mean the monitor is never retired on a count of wakes. Every other limit must
be positive.

## Understand when the agent runs

Kiro Crew probes and compares provider facts before it invokes the conversation:

| Observation | Agent turns |
|---|---:|
| No material change | 0 |
| Checks still pending | 0 |
| Provider retry | 0 |
| Review-ready success or terminal blocker | 0 |
| New actionable fingerprint | At most 1 |

An actionable wake includes a compact summary. The agent can then fetch only the
logs, comments, or diff needed for that change. Kiro Crew retains accepted
fingerprints across restart, so the same revision is not handled twice.

Terminal success does not wake the conversation. The dashboard instead reports
success, a terminal blocker, an exhausted budget, or an unavailable owning
session. Use a finite legacy loop when you require a final conversational report
even if the pull request needs no action.

## Inspect or change a monitor

Use `monitor_inspect` on a later turn to see the target, objective, next probe,
limits, latest classification, usage, and final outcome.

You can change the cadence, limits, and wake instructions without
discarding the comparison baseline. Changing the target or objective starts a
new baseline and is refused while an action is in flight.

Monitoring never grants extra tool authority. An action turn uses the normal
governance and approval policy of its conversation.

## Stop or restart a monitor

Stop the monitor from the dashboard or ask the agent to stop it. The stop is
durable: inspection retains a `user_stop` outcome instead of deleting the
evidence. Success, provider or authentication blocks, exhausted budgets,
unavailable sessions, and missing completion evidence also retain specific
terminal reasons.

Terminal records are read-only. Choose Restart in the dashboard or ask the agent
to start a new watch.

## Use a finite legacy loop

For unsupported evidence or targets, ask Kiro Crew to run a same-session goal
loop with a positive interval, cycle cap, and runtime limit. Every delivered
cycle is a full agent turn, extends the conversation, and spends model and tool
tokens even when nothing changed.

The acknowledgement is only an arm request, so confirm the active goal loop in
the dashboard. Stop it when the objective is met, the target becomes terminal,
or a person must decide. Normal approval rules still apply; an unattended action
may request approval, be rejected, or time out.
