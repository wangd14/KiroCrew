    The static half of the runtime detector in
    :mod:`kiro_crew.acp.mcp_ref_guard`, answering the same question before a
    session rather than during one. The defect it names has shipped on three
    harnesses (``providers/mirrors/README.md``): a session comes up with
    ``tools: ["@kirocrew-core", ...]`` and nothing defining ``kirocrew-core``, so
    every Crew tool is absent while the harness works and nothing anywhere is red.
    A row here is the answer to "my agent has no tools on this backend" that
    otherwise takes a diagnosis.

    Reports only, and appends NO entry to ``issues``, on the terms
    :func:`_doctor_strict_identity` sets: a harness the operator has not adopted
    having no projection yet is a known state of the tree, not a broken install,
    and failing doctor's exit code on it would make every stock host red for a
    backend nobody selected.

    Asks ``agent_sdk`` rather than assembling the answer here. The refs need the
    agent spec and each backend's spec projection, both of which live below the
    boundary, so reaching them from this module would take three new ACP /
    providers edges the agent-sdk-boundary gate refuses -- and correctly: which
    file a harness reads its servers from is exactly the knowledge a consumer is
    not supposed to hold. ``agent_spec_mcp_refs`` reads the mirror seam, so a
    backend projecting outside ``providers/mirrors/`` (KAS) reads as unprojected;
    ``has_mirror`` is what lets the row say which case it is.

    kiro-cli resolves its refs against the spec it is handed, so a healthy install
    prints a clean row there rather than every ref it declares -- the resolver keys
    that on the backend id, not on this function.

    harness the operator actually configured, and it answers it for a spec that

    can carry Crew's servers, so every Crew tool is absent from its sessions
    whatever the spec says. That is a property of the harness, not of the spec,
    and a spec with an empty ``tools`` list produces no unresolved ref to hang it
    off.

    The no-channel row prints only for that one kind. ``native``, ``mirror`` and

    """The MCP ability of the harness IN USE, and which others cost a whole server.

    The rows above answer for the selected harness only when something about it is
    wrong. This answers what a reader asks before switching, and what the selected
    harness is doing to their agent file right now: these harnesses are not
    interchangeable, and every way they differ over the spec has until now lived in
    source, in a spec document, or in a log line nobody reads.

    **Two lines on a stock run, not a table.** The full per-harness comparison is the
    dashboard's job -- it has the room, the labels in thirteen languages, and a reader
    who came to compare. A terminal report is read by someone diagnosing one install,
    and a row apiece for six harnesses on every run is a section people learn to skip,
    which costs the report more than the comparison was worth. So exactly two facts
    print here:

    * the ability card of the harness IN USE -- its projection kind, the reach of a
      per-tool MCP restriction, and the spec keys it withholds or has no channel for.
      This one is not a comparison: it is what the reader's own sessions are doing;
    * the harnesses where switching one tool off can withhold CREW'S OWN servers, named
      on one line, because that is the fact a chooser needs before they switch and the
      one an operator otherwise meets by accident. Narrower than "costs a whole server"
      on purpose: a ``per-call`` harness withholds a third-party server whole and still
      refuses per tool on Crew's own, so its session keeps the channel it came from and
      the panel is where that difference has room to be explained.

    Everything else about the harnesses not in use -- their withholds, their gaps,
    their kinds -- is in the panel, which is where a reader comparing harnesses is: this
    report answers for the install in front of it and names the one cross-harness cost
    that a chooser cannot act without.

    **Values, not prose, and the ROUTE lives here.** The row prints what the
    declaration says -- the kind and the reach in the registry's own spelling -- rather
    than an English gloss of it. The panel owns the prose, and it deliberately owns
    LESS: ``native``/``mirror``/``external`` costs a reader choosing a harness nothing,
    so the card does not carry it and this report is where it is stated. The register
    suits that reader anyway: they are in a terminal and the next thing they do is read
    ``providers/mirrors/registry.py``.

    **One consequence sentence, for one reach.** The exception, and it is not a gloss
    of the row: ``whole-server`` means switching a single tool off withholds the whole
    server that tool belongs to, and where that server is ``kirocrew-core`` that
    session cannot report back to the channel it came from. Conditional because the
    condition is real -- a narrowed third-party server costs that server and not the
    channel -- and a reader who only ever sees the declared value recovers neither.
    Which reaches carry the cost at all is the projection's judgement
    (``McpAbility.costs_control_plane``), not this report's.

    Nothing is authored per harness, so a newly onboarded backend is covered the moment
    its ``PROJECTIONS`` entry exists.

    Reports only, and appends NO entry to ``issues``, on the terms every row in this
    neighbourhood sets: a declared difference between harnesses is what the
    declaration is FOR, and failing doctor's exit code on one would make choosing a
    harness read as a fault. It declares; it changes nothing and gates nothing.

    Asks ``agent_sdk`` rather than reading ``providers/mirrors`` here: the declaration
    lives below the boundary and reaching it from a consumer would take an edge the
    agent-sdk-boundary gate refuses. Both surfaces of this card, and what each owes a
    reader, are written down once in ``providers/mirrors/README.md`` ("Fill the card").
