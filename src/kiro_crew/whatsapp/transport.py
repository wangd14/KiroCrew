"""Layer 1 — WhatsApp (QR-linked personal account) as a ``MessagingTransport``.

Wraps :class:`kiro_crew.whatsapp.client.WhatsAppClient` in the channel-neutral
transport contract. Dependency direction is ``whatsapp -> messaging``
(allowed); ``messaging`` never imports ``whatsapp``.

The inbound pipeline in :meth:`WhatsAppTransport.receive` is a gauntlet every
event must survive, in order:

1. **shape**: the message is unwrapped (ephemeral, view-once and edited
   messages carry the real one inside) and classified by
   :mod:`kiro_crew.whatsapp.media`. Anything that yields neither text, nor
   ingestible media, nor a note worth showing is dropped;
2. **flood gate**: messages older than the connection moment are history
   replay after a reconnect. Never answer a backlog (marks nothing read);
3. **echo gate**: a ``from_me`` message whose ID we sent is our own echo;
   a ``from_me`` message we did NOT send is the operator typing (self-chat
   command surface);
4. **group gate**: group chats are dropped unless configured, then gated by
   mode/mention/cooldown (:mod:`kiro_crew.whatsapp.group_gate`);
5. **authorize**: deny-by-default, with SEL audit on every denial. A DM is
   judged by ``dm_policy`` (``self`` default). A GROUP message is judged by the
   per-sender allowlist, exactly as every other channel judges group traffic:
   the linked account always passes, any other member must be listed in
   ``allowed_wa_ids``, and an empty list admits nobody but the operator. The
   group gate above decides whether the agent may SPEAK in the group; this step
   decides whether the PERSON may make it speak, and it runs for mention,
   reply and rules-mode unprompted turns alike, so an unlisted member cannot
   trigger a reply of any kind. ``dm_policy`` is deliberately not consulted for
   a group: ``open`` would re-admit every member of a configured group;
6. **media fetch**, and only here, and only for an INDIVIDUALLY admitted sender.
   Downloading before this point would let anyone who can message the number
   trigger an authenticated fetch on the operator's host with no authorization
   behind it. Step 5 answers that for a DM through ``dm_policy``; a group sender
   takes the same individual test again at the fetch
   (:meth:`WhatsAppTransport._may_fetch_media`), so the download stays gated on
   the linked account or an explicitly allowed number even if a future caller
   reaches the fetch by another path.

Capabilities (personal account over the Web protocol): the reply streams by
editing one bubble, because this protocol exposes an edit where the Business
Cloud API does not; media rides the shared ingest and upload paths; reactions
carry phase receipts. ``max_buttons=0``, and unlike the other zero-widget channels
this renderer does not fall back to a numbered list: ``turn_renderer._strip_options``
removes a COMPLETE ``[OPTIONS:]`` trailer from the reply, so a question whose
choices live only there reaches the user without them. A tool approval is
unaffected -- ``on_prompt_choice`` builds its own numbered prompt. Declaring no
widget is a deliberately conservative choice, NOT a platform ceiling: the pinned
wheel ships a complete interactive-message builder and a poll builder, and what is
unverified is whether a recipient's client renders a native-flow message sent from
a PERSONAL linked device rather than a Business account. Recording it as impossible
would close the door on every future picker here, so it is recorded as unverified.
Losing the list is a gap rather than a position; ``docs/channel-capabilities.md``
records it for a reader. Unlike
the Business Cloud API there is no 24-hour window, so
``supports_proactive_send=True`` and reminders work.

        Called by the dispatcher's config applier when ``config.json`` changes
        under ``whatsapp``, so a policy, allow-list or group-rule edit from the
        dashboard, the CLI or ``$EDITOR`` takes effect on the next stanza instead
        of the next restart. Each holder is REPLACED wholesale (never mutated) so
        an in-flight decision keeps reading one consistent value: the frozen DM
        allow-list, and the ``GroupGate`` -- rebuilt from the same
        ``_coerce_whatsapp_groups`` pass the loader applies, which is what makes
        an unknown ``mode`` fall back to ``mention`` rather than to a mode that
        speaks unprompted.

        Fails closed on shape: a ``dm_policy`` that is not a string, or an
        allow-list that is not a list, keeps the PREVIOUS value and logs at
        WARNING. An unknown policy STRING is adopted, because ``_dm_policy``
        denies everyone it does not recognize -- refusing to adopt it would leave
        the wider previous policy in force. Policy flips and roster changes are
        SEL-audited; a wa_id is a phone number, so the audit counts, never lists.

        Rebuilding the gate resets its unprompted-reply cooldown clock, which is
        the conservative direction only for the cooldown's purpose (rate limiting
        the agent's own speech), so the gate is rebuilt only when the coerced
        rules actually differ.

        ``whatsapp.db_path`` is not reloadable at all: the device store is opened

        the account's phone JID *and* its ``@lid`` alias -- while all that

        dropped. Re-deriving from that string would answer a narrower question
        than the one already answered, and would answer it wrong for an operator
        addressed by an alias.

        object ``receive`` dispatched, so anything else -- a replay, a synthetic
        message, a caller reaching past the gauntlet -- is not the operator.
