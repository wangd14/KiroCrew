"""The ``RegisterTaskDefinition`` document for a crew's Fargate task, as data.

Nothing here calls AWS. Every AWS interaction in this package goes through the
single ``aws`` CLI chokepoint in :mod:`kiro_crew.cloud.aws`, which refuses a
non-read-only call from an agent session. Producing the document as a value
instead is what makes the two security decisions it carries reviewable without a
credential: they are properties of a ``dict``, and a test can state them.

## What a revision is keyed on

One family per crew, one revision per (image digest, secret ARN set, cpu
architecture, log configuration, store). The key is not a preference, it is what
``RunTask`` can and cannot override. ``RunTask`` overrides ``cpu``, ``memory``,
``ephemeralStorage``, ``taskRoleArn``, ``executionRoleArn`` and a container's
``command`` and ``environment``. It cannot override ``image``, ``secrets``,
``logConfiguration``, ``runtimePlatform``, ``volumes`` or ``mountPoints``. Those
are therefore the only fields a launch cannot bend at run time, so they are the
only ones that can force a new revision.

Two consequences follow, and :func:`revision_fingerprint` is written so both are
testable rather than asserted. Keying on size is wrong, because size is an
override. Registering per launch is wrong, because ``RegisterTaskDefinition``
has no upsert and leaks a revision on every call. Steady state is one API call,
two on the first launch of a new digest.

``portMappings``, ``networkMode`` and ``requiresCompatibilities`` are also
beyond ``RunTask``'s reach and are still not in the key, because the key is the
fields that are unoverridable AND variable. The front port is a constant of the
image, so it cannot vary and cannot force a revision. It is a module constant
here rather than an input for exactly that reason.

## How the credential arrives

Through ``secrets[].valueFrom``, fetched by the execution role before the
container starts. Not through a ``ContainerOverride``, which has no ``secrets``
field at all: the only way to put a credential in a ``RunTask`` request is
``environment``, in plain text, where it is written to the CloudTrail record of
the request and can be read back out of ``DescribeTasks``. The value in question
is a long-lived model credential.

:func:`task_definition_document` therefore refuses a spec that does not deliver
the model credential through ``secrets``, and
:func:`kiro_crew.cloud.fargate.runtask.run_task_request` refuses an
``environment`` override naming anything ``secrets`` delivers. The two halves
are one property: the credential always arrives, and it arrives only this way.

CREW_CONTAINER_NAME = "crew"

#: The environment variable carrying the model identity into the container. The
#: container's own definition of this name is the authority; a test pins the two
#: together, because a drift here delivers the secret under a name the supervisor does
#: not read and the supervisor refuses to start.
#:
#: The value is one ``KasToken`` document as JSON, not an API key: the supervisor
#: writes it into the crew's vault and the relay obtains bearer tokens from there
#: through the host auth callback, which is what keeps any credential out of the model
#: worker's environment.
MODEL_CREDENTIAL_ENV = "KIRO_IDENTITY"

#: kiro-cli's API-key credential. Nothing delivers it, and it is named here so a
#: ``RunTask`` request cannot introduce it: the container withholds it from the
#: backend, and ``verify_sandbox`` refuses an unsandboxed start if it appears anyway.
API_KEY_ENV = "KIRO_API_KEY"

#: The front process's control-plane secret. It gates every route except the two
#: customer ones and keys the audit HMAC, so its value is a credential in the
#: same sense the model key's is.
CONTROL_SECRET_ENV = "SMC_CONTROL_SECRET"

#: Every environment variable whose value the container reads as a credential.
#: A ``RunTask`` request refuses all of them, and the refusal is over this SET
#: rather than over any one name: covering one credential and not its sibling is
#: how a guard passes review while the same path stays open beside it.
#:
#: The container curates the set, not this module. It marks a name as a
#: credential in one of two ways, both of which a test derives from the container
#: source with ``ast`` in both directions: the supervisor POPS it from the model
#: worker's environment (so prompt-reachable code cannot read it), or
#: ``seed_model_identity`` consumes it as the delivered identity. A credential added
#: there fails that test until it is refused here, and a name refused here that the
#: container does not read shows up as drift rather than accumulating quietly.
CREDENTIAL_ENV = frozenset({MODEL_CREDENTIAL_ENV, API_KEY_ENV, CONTROL_SECRET_ENV})

#: The port the task's front process listens on. A constant of the image, not a
#: launch parameter, so ``portMappings`` can stay out of the revision key.
FRONT_PORT = 8080

#: The data home inside the container: where session transcripts, the archive,
#: artifacts and the installed crew bundle live. A constant of the image, which
#: creates this directory and sets ``KIROCREW_HOME``, ``SMC_DATA_HOME`` and
#: ``SMC_CONFIG_DIR`` to it, so a mount anywhere else backs a directory nothing
#: reads and leaves the transcripts on the task's own disk. Pinned to the image's
#: own ``ENV`` by a test that reads the Dockerfile, because the two agreeing is
#: the whole property and a drift on either side is silent.
#:
#: POSIX-only by construction, and not a host path. It is a path inside a Linux
#: container, emitted as a string into the ``RegisterTaskDefinition`` document
#: beside ``operatingSystemFamily`` LINUX; nothing on the machine producing the
#: document ever opens it. Resolving it through the running host's temporary
#: directory or path rules would put that host's layout into an AWS API document,
#: which is why it is spelled literally here.
CREW_DATA_HOME = "/var/lib/kirocrew"

#: Name tying the task's volume to the container's mount point. Both halves are
#: generated here, so the name is a module constant rather than an input: a
#: ``mountPoints[].sourceVolume`` naming no declared volume is refused by
#: ``RegisterTaskDefinition``, and a caller cannot get a value it never supplies
#: wrong.
CREW_STORE_VOLUME_NAME = "crew-data"

#: Task-level cpu and memory exist only because ``RegisterTaskDefinition``
#: requires them for a Fargate task. Every launch overrides them, so this pair
#: is the smallest valid Fargate combination and never an intended runtime
#: shape. ``run_task_request`` refuses a launch that supplies no size rather
#: than letting this floor become the size a task actually runs at.
REGISTRATION_CPU = "256"
REGISTRATION_MEMORY = "512"

#: Fargate CPU architectures. Part of ``runtimePlatform``, so part of the key.
CPU_ARCHITECTURES = frozenset({"X86_64", "ARM64"})

#: The only operating-system family a crew image is built for.
OPERATING_SYSTEM_FAMILY = "LINUX"

#: How long the platform must wait after SIGTERM before it SIGKILLs the crew container.
#:
#: The number is one contract split across two subsystems: the supervisor inside the
#: image drains its three children in sequence, and the LAST of those windows is the
#: backup writer's final cycle -- the only copy of the turns the backend flushed on the
#: way out. Fargate's default is 30s, which the front and backend drains alone can
#: consume, so without this the writer is killed before that cycle starts, the supervisor
#: dies with it, and the non-zero exit that reports the loss is never delivered. Every
#: routine deploy would then lose up to one backup interval of turns silently.
#:
#: A DELIBERATE DUPLICATE of the total in the image's ``container/common/config.py``, not
#: an import of it. That tree runs inside the Linux image on an installed layout where
#: ``kiro_crew`` is absent, so importing it here would fail at runtime and would pull an
#: audit-exempt tree into gateway code. The two copies are pinned equal from the test
#: suite, which reads the image tree's source as data rather than importing it.
#:
#: The total is the three drain windows PLUS the teardown reap margin, because draining is
#: signal, wait, sweep and reap rather than only the children's own time. Pinning this to
#: the windows alone left it ten seconds short of what the image asks the platform for.
CREW_STOP_TIMEOUT_SECS = 100

#: Tag recording the revision key on the revision itself, so the account can
#: answer what a revision was keyed on. Without it a lost local cache has no
#: witness, and the launcher re-registers, which is the revision leak the key
#: exists to prevent.
FINGERPRINT_TAG_KEY = "kirocrew:revision-key"

#: Tag naming the crew, so a revision and a task can be attributed without
#: parsing an ARN out of them.
#: The value the managed marker must carry. It is DERIVED and no caller reaches it.
#:
#: Whatever identifies a resource as this system's is what teardown finds it by,
#: and the rest of the code base matches this tag BY VALUE, not merely by key:
#: ``cloud/ec2.py`` discovers with ``Key=kirocrew:managed,Values=true`` and refuses
#: to touch a stack whose value is not ``true``, and ``cloud/iam.py`` conditions
#: resource permissions on ``aws:ResourceTag/kirocrew:managed`` equalling ``true``.
#: A task carrying any other value is therefore a RUNNING task that teardown does
#: not enumerate and the teardown role is not permitted to stop, billing in the
#: owner's account with nothing pointing at it. That is the failure the RFC's third
#: exit criterion is about, so the marker is not a caller's field to fill.
MANAGED_TAG_VALUE = "true"

CREW_TAG_KEY = "kirocrew:crew"

#: Version of the fingerprint payload, hashed with it. A future change to which
#: fields are hashed becomes a visibly different key rather than a silent
#: collision with keys computed under the old shape.
#:
#: Scheme 3 hashes the store alongside the other four unoverridable fields, and
#: the container definition carries ``linuxParameters.initProcessEnabled``. Two
#: separate reasons a key must not be read across schemes: a hashed field set that
#: differs, and a constant in the document that does not appear in the payload at
#: all. The second is why the scheme exists -- hashing cannot tell two documents
#: apart over a field neither of them varies -- so a caller confirming "revision N
#: holds the content this spec describes" compares schemes, not only hashes.
#:
#: Scheme 4 adds ``stopTimeout`` (``CREW_STOP_TIMEOUT_SECS``) to the container
#: definition. That constant is not in the payload either, so without the bump a
#: revision registered before it carries an identical key while running a document
#: whose stop timeout is Fargate's 30s default -- the same silent collision the
#: init-process field already made this scheme guard against.
FINGERPRINT_SCHEME = 4

#: A digest-pinned image reference: ``<repository>@sha256:<64 hex>``. A tag is
#: refused. A tag can be moved after a revision is registered, which leaves the
#: revision key identifying something other than the image content, and that
#: identity is the premise every property built on the key depends on.
