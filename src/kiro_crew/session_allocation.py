        session's turn semaphore, or a cold start still ahead of the pre-spawn
        fence check, has started nothing and will be held or refused before it
        does. Two things are named. A reservation in ``spawning_reservations`` --
        past that door, its ``provider.start()`` in flight or returned but
        unregistered -- is a process the passes could not see: refused at
        registration and hard-killed there, but not answered by the caller's own
        passes. And a receipt in ``refused_spawns``: a start the fence caught that
        already returned during the passes, was refused and had its provider
        hard-killed by the allocation path -- a kill dispatched off the loop
        whose outcome nothing here reads back, so the record cannot call that
        process gone either. The phrase returned is the reason the caller records.
