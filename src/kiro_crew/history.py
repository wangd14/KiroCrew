# The subset of :data:`SLOT_OWNED_META_KEYS` a ROWS-ONLY slot save still owns.
#
# A save that must persist a slot's messages onto a transcript whose metadata line

# rebuild would revert the other slot's title, folder, tags or pin. Such a save
# preserves every slot-owned field the line already carries and keeps authority
# over only these — the file's identity and accounting, which every writer
# maintains and which the save carries forward from disk anyway.
#
# ``closed``/``closed_at`` are NOT here, even though the write is open-shaped and
# the whole claim above would erase them. On a line another slot published, a
# ``closed`` flag is that holder's own DISMISSAL, and the two mistakes cost
# differently. Erasing a dismissal the holder just committed resurfaces a tab the
# user put away and re-arms the channel reconciler on it, with the holder already
# popped so nothing rewrites the flag. Leaving a stale flag in place instead costs
# nothing durable: the live holder owns these keys on its own next full save.
#
# The one path that DOES clear a stale flag from outside the holder is the resume
# route, and it only clears one it can prove predates its own boundary
# (``clear_closed(..., only_if_closed_before=...)``, compared inside the store's
# lock) — precisely because an unconditional clear "reopens a replacement the user
# closed". A rows-only save carries no such boundary, so it defers, the same way
# every other field on another writer's line does.
#
# Narrowing this far is only correct against ANOTHER slot's line, so the save
# establishes that first (from the line's ``tab_id``) and falls back to the full
# claim otherwise. Applied to a slot's own line it would strand that slot's
# uncommitted metadata instead of protecting anyone's — and that fallback is where
# an open-shaped write still clears a stale ``closed``, because a line this slot
# published carries no other holder's dismissal to lose.

# under-approximates: the slot save also writes fields that DESCRIBE an owned one
# without being owned themselves (absence must not erase them, so they are
# deliberately outside the ownership claim and survive via
# :func:`carry_unowned_metadata`). Deferring the described field while keeping the
# describing one commits a line that matches NEITHER slot — worse than either,
# because each half is separately valid and nothing downstream can detect the
# mismatch. ``title_origin`` and ``title_refresh_mark`` are the title's provenance
# and its background-refresh budget: read back beside another slot's title they
# either unlock the refresh on a name a user typed by hand or lock a generated name
# out of refresh permanently. They travel WITH the title, so they are deferred with
# it. ``title_low_signal`` is the same shape — the early-refresh eligibility of
# THIS slot's title — so a popped slot's stale flag carried over a live
# replacement's would wrongly suppress or re-arm the replacement's turn-one
# refresh after restart. It defers with the title too.
#
# ``created_by`` and ``origin`` are the same shape and the highest-consequence
# instance of it, because what they describe is AUTHORIZATION rather than
# presentation. ``created_by`` is the attribution the member ownership boundary in
# session-control reads, and it is meaningless without the ``mode`` that is deferred
# beside it — a member ``mode`` from the live holder read next to a different
# principal's ``created_by`` names an owner who never opened this session.
# ``origin`` must round-trip with ``app``, also deferred: split, a tab reads back as
# one holder's slot kind wearing the other's app binding, which is what decides
# ``slots:user`` visibility and the unattended approval window. Both are attributes
# of the SLOT, not facts about the conversation, so on a transcript with a live
# holder the holder's are the true ones. Deferring them also fails CLOSED where the
# line carries none: an absent ``created_by`` denies rather than grants, and an
# absent ``origin`` restores to the empty sentinel the rehydrate paths already treat
# that way.
#
# What is left out is left out deliberately: ``auto_tagged``, ``human_seen``,
# ``channel_origin`` and ``channel_folder_filed`` are MONOTONE once-flags about the
# CONVERSATION, set and never cleared, so a shared transcript's two writers cannot
# disagree about them in a way that outlives the pair.

    A writer that reconstructs a transcript's metadata line from its own state
    (the dashboard slot save, :meth:`ConversationLog.compact`) is authoritative
    ONLY for the keys it writes: for those, absence is meaningful and must erase
    (clearing a title, un-pinning, reopening a closed tab). For every OTHER key
    absence means "not mine to know about", so reconstructing the subset silently
    deletes another layer's durable state.

    Enumerating the foreign keys to preserve instead is the failure mode this
    replaces: each new field has to be added to every rebuilder, and the one that
    is missed loses data with no error — the rotation generation and the
    consolidation retry accounting were both erased that way. So *owned* names the
    writer's OWN keys and everything else is carried through verbatim, making
    preservation the default and erasure the deliberate act.

    Preservation is unconditional, INCLUDING the consolidation retry accounting
    (:data:`_CONSOLIDATION_META_KEYS`), because a rebuild is not evidence about
    content: a slot flush re-serializes the same window, and a compaction archives
    turns the budget has already measured without introducing any the LLM has not
    seen — erasing the accounting there resets a live backoff and resumes billed
    retries.

    A save that genuinely EDITS the conversation is distinguished by the content
    identity it writes, not by what this helper drops: the dashboard rewrite path
    advances ``rotation_generation``, which releases the budget through the span
    identity the accounting is stamped with (see :class:`AttemptedSpan` and
    :meth:`ConversationLog._attempts_describe_current_span`) and invalidates any
    in-flight attempt's marker write. Keeping that in ONE counter is what makes an

    Why a channel row needs one AT WRITE TIME: the dashboard's merge keys on

    that materializes it (``channel_slots._rebuild_window`` /
    ``refresh_channel_window``), so one logical row carries a different identity on
    every pass, silently degrading all three at once.

    Random rather than a per-key counter, for the reason ``_ChatSlot.append``
    gives: a counter rebased after a restore can reissue an id a restored row
    already holds, and a colliding id makes a client DROP a real message. A

    built on :func:`transcript_sort_key` -- is then free to render the answer
    above the question that prompted it.

    Returning ``previous`` plus one microsecond when the clock has not advanced
    makes the order a property of the write sequence rather than of the clock's

    rows carry two stored formats (aware and naive isoformat), so ``"a" > "b"``
    on the raw strings compares different domains and can pick the earlier row.

    An UNPARSEABLE candidate is skipped rather than ranked. ``transcript_sort_key``
    deliberately buckets a value it cannot parse *after* every real instant, so
    that a corrupt line displays at the end of a transcript rather than in the

    ranked, one malformed ``ts`` would win here, and
    :func:`monotonic_transcript_ts` ignores a previous value it cannot parse — so
    a single corrupt row on disk would silently switch the whole ordering
    guarantee off and let the next row tie its predecessor again.

    ``None`` and empty candidates are ignored too, so a caller can pass a value it

        asks whether the row is still open, this asks whether it is still the same

        There is no transcript-identity guard here, unlike the two writers: a close
        only ever narrows what the index already claims, so a parent recreated under
        its own key cannot be harmed by one, and the guard would need a caller to
        pass an identity none of them holds.

        *expect_open* makes the close a compare-and-set: the row must still be OPEN
        for the change to land. Without it, two closes racing on one anchor both
        read it open, both merge, and both go on to post a summary card in the
        parent -- so closing once is a property of this lock, not of the caller's
        earlier read. A caller that is only amending an already-closed row (storing
        the card's id) leaves it false.

        Read-modify-write under :meth:`_locked`, like
        :meth:`write_thread_anchor`, so a close cannot race an open on the same
        index. The merged row is re-validated, so a change that would leave the
        row outside :func:`_thread_anchor_row`'s shape is refused rather than
        written. ``_transcript_holds_mid`` is deliberately NOT re-checked: a

        into someone else's temp directory. The agent scratch dir the picture
        usually lives in is reclaimed when the agent process dies, so without

        *mid*, and by ``(role, content)`` plus the SAME ``meta.mid`` when it
        does (see below).

        The disk check and the append run together under ``_locked`` so they
        are ATOMIC against a concurrent writer of the same session file — in
        particular the periodic dashboard slot save
        (``_save_slot_to_history``), which serializes the in-memory slot window
        (already carrying this message via ``slot.append``) and takes the SAME
        per-session cross-process lock. Without this, a fire-and-forget
        :func:`append_off_loop` scheduled after the slot save has already
        written the identical message would append it a SECOND time; the
        duplicate then survives a restart and is replayed twice to subsequent
        agent turns. This is the workflow-result / cron-result double-append
        race: the read-modify-write must be one locked critical section, not a
        separate unlocked existence check followed by a later append.

        What counts as "already persisted" depends on whether the caller holds
        an identity. Without *mid*, any row with the same ``(role, content)``
        does — body equality is all an id-less writer can check. WITH *mid*,
        a same-role row carrying the SAME ``meta.mid`` AND a corroborating
        body does: equal, or equal modulo preserved images
        (:func:`same_text_modulo_images`). That row is this very message,
        landed by the slot save or an earlier attempt of this write. The
        image allowance is there because the slot save rewrites an inline
        image to its stored copy, and if the agent's scratch file is gone by
        the time this append runs, the rewrite here fails open to the
        original path — strict body equality would miss the row and append a
        duplicate under the same id naming a dead file. The corroboration
        itself stays required because ``meta.mid`` is caller-suppliable, so a
        bare id equality could pair two genuinely distinct messages. A
        body-equal row under another id (or none) is a DIFFERENT occurrence
        that happens to repeat the text — an id-carrying twin of an earlier
        injection, or a pre-id legacy row — and skipping on it would drop
        THIS occurrence's only durable copy: the in-memory window is lost on
        restart, so nothing would replay the newer message.

        *offset* is an absolute message index captured by the caller BEFORE a
        (potentially slow) LLM consolidation call. *generation* is the rotation
        generation counter (:meth:`rotation_generation`) captured at the same
        moment. It advances on anything that changes the content under a
        consolidation in flight, and each case makes the caller's *offset*
        meaningless in a different way:

        * A **rotation** truncated the file to its newest messages and reset
          ``last_consolidated`` to 0, so every surviving index shifted by the
          number of dropped lines and applying the offset would mark
          never-consolidated retained messages as processed.
        * A **transcript edit** (the dashboard regenerate / rewind / fork save)
          replaced the live window's tail with content this turn never read. The
          message count, the marker and the extent can all be unchanged, so the
          offset still *looks* applicable — and applying it would mark the
          REPLACEMENT tail consolidated without ever extracting it.

        Both are silent memory loss, and the generation is what distinguishes
        them from a turn whose span is still intact.

        Detection uses two independent signals:

        1. **Generation change** (primary, when *generation* is supplied):
           anything that changes the content between snapshot and write bumps the
           counter, so a mismatch resets ``last_consolidated`` to 0. This closes
           both cases a pure offset-vs-count heuristic misses — a rotation that
           keeps >= *offset* messages, and an edit that keeps the count identical,
           each leave ``offset <= msg_count`` true.
        2. **Offset exceeds current count** (fallback, always): the file shrank
           below the captured offset (rotation truncated it). Retained if
           *generation* is unavailable (legacy callers) or as defense-in-depth.

        In either case ``last_consolidated`` is reset to 0 and the retained tail
        is reconsolidated rather than clamping the offset to EOF (which would
        silently mark post-rotation messages as already consolidated and drop
        them from memory/history extraction). When neither trips, the offset is
        applied as-is.

        (the consolidator's own throttle is in-memory only) and is cleared by

        no failed attempt is on record — the common case — so callers can treat a
        missing entry as "eligible now".

        Read UNCACHED. The accounting is cross-process (a gateway sweep, the CLI,

        these fields restores the file's pre-write mtime so housekeeping does not

        second process can update its durable count between a warm read and the
        following increment. Dropping the entry first costs one first-line read.

        Metadata is caller-supplied JSON, so every conversion is defensive:
        ``1e309`` parses to ``inf`` and ``int(inf)`` raises ``OverflowError``
        (which would surface as a 500 from the manual trigger or break the idle
        sweep), while a ``NaN`` deadline makes every ``now >= retry_at``
        comparison false and disables consolidation for the session forever.

        A span is identified by where it starts AND how far it reaches: the
        ``(rotation_generation, last_consolidated)`` pair it was charged against
        plus the message count that was actually attempted. While a span keeps
        failing none of the three move — the marker is only advanced on success —
        so the cap holds across attempts. Anything that changes the CONTENT under
        the counter moves one of them: a rotation and a dashboard rewrite
        (regenerate / rewind / fork) both advance the generation, a rewrite that
        cannot apply a stale offset resets the marker, and new messages push the
        transcript past the extent that was attempted.

        The generation is what covers the edit that moves nothing else. A
        regenerate replaces the assistant tail with a reply the failing turns
        never saw and lands at the same message count, the same marker and the
        same extent, so without the bump a capped budget would sit over brand-new
        content and refuse it forever.

        The extent matters because the cap is what ABANDONS a span, and it is only
        reachable from :meth:`HistoryConsolidator.retry_eligible` when the
        abandon-marker write itself failed. Without it, that one transient write
        failure would refuse the session forever: appended messages leave the
        generation and marker untouched, so every entry point would keep rejecting
        a transcript that is no longer the one that failed, and the session's
        history would never be consolidated again.

        *message_count* is the transcript's CURRENT total, supplied by the caller.
        It is never read from disk here: this predicate runs inside
        ``retry_eligible`` on the gateway event loop, and a synchronous full-file
        read there stalls every other gateway task on a large transcript. Callers
        that already hold a count pass it (see :meth:`consolidation_counts`);
        ``None`` means "no count available", which skips the extent test and keeps
        the cap — the conservative direction, since the alternative is spending a
        billed turn on an unverified premise.

        Growth is compared with ``>`` rather than ``!=`` on purpose. A count that
        SHRANK is a rotation or compaction, which already moves the generation or
        the marker; treating a shrink as new content on its own would hand a
        budget to a span with nothing added to it.

        Unstamped accounting (written before a given field existed) is treated as
        belonging to the current span, so an unknown provenance keeps the cap
        rather than granting an unbounded supply of billed retries.

        The stamp this compares against is the ATTEMPTED span, captured before the
        turn (see :class:`AttemptedSpan`), which is what makes all three tests
        meaningful: if the stamp were re-read after the turn it would describe the
        transcript in front of us by construction, and every test here would
        trivially match.
