"""Kiro Crew snapshot and restore — portable state management.

The command and API facade. ``snapshot`` and ``restore`` are implemented here, together
with the seam that prepares a redacted copy for an off-host upload. ``restore_main``
sequences extraction and the bundle-shape refusals, and writes their
``state_restore_rejected`` audits. The rules both commands apply live in owner modules and
are re-exported below, so every existing import keeps resolving. The owners read the
helpers, drivers and limits a test replaces through this module at call time
(:func:`kiro_crew.snapshot_components._facade`), so a patch of one of those names here
reaches the owners' call sites too. Every other name resolves in the owner that defines or
imports it, and a patch of it belongs on that owner.

* :mod:`kiro_crew.snapshot_components` -- the component table and the tree-root check
* :mod:`kiro_crew.snapshot_archive` -- staging and the bundle format: the pinned copy, the
  extraction filter, the archive bound and the manifest readers
* :mod:`kiro_crew.snapshot_restore` -- the bundle predicates, the content-soundness refusal,
  the destination guards, and the replace transaction with its rollback
* :mod:`kiro_crew.snapshot_merge` -- merge-mode algorithms

    be contained at: everything in here either produces a finished archive or raises,
    and the caller turns a :class:`kiro_crew.pinned_fs.PinnedPathRefusal` into an exit
    code rather than a traceback.

    *selected* names the components to stage and *purpose* what the bundle is for; both
    are resolved by the caller so this function never has to decide policy. Staging is
    per-component rather than over one flat file table, which is what makes
    ``--components memory`` a complete memory backup instead of a subset of one.

    They DEFAULT rather than being required, because callers that predate the component
    seam ask for a whole-home archive and should keep getting one: an omitted *selected*
    means every component, which is what ``snapshot`` without ``--components`` has always
    produced. Making them mandatory broke those callers with a TypeError instead.

    *skipped_out*, when given, is extended with the same records this function writes to
    ``MANIFEST.json``'s ``skipped``. An out-parameter rather than a second return value
    on purpose: the return type is a ``Path`` that several tests use directly, so
    widening it would be a seam move with fallout, and the caller needs only to know
    WHETHER anything was omitted.

    *name* names the TARBALL and *root_name* the directory inside it, and they are two
    parameters rather than one because a selective bundle marks only the inner directory.
    Collapsing them renamed the tarball too, and ``--list``, pruning and ``--keep`` all
    glob ``kirocrew-snapshot-*.tar.gz`` -- so every partial bundle became invisible to
    rotation and accumulated without bound. Defaults to *name* for a complete bundle.

    Refuses outright where ``O_NOFOLLOW`` does not exist -- see below. The refusal is
    made HERE, before the executor is acquired and before anything is opened, because

    The whole body runs on the dashboard's notification worker when one exists, so a

    WHY A MISSING ``O_NOFOLLOW`` REFUSES INSTEAD OF FALLING BACK. The predecessor
    checked ``pinned_fs.is_reparse_point(src_path)`` by NAME and then opened the same
    NAME. Against an adversary that is not a floor, it is a check-to-open window: the
    threat model this function is written for -- stated in ``_install_notifications``
    and demonstrated by the revision review blocked -- is a concurrent agent replacing
    the extracted file, and such an agent chooses the timing. The descriptor check does
    not save it either: ``fstat`` asserts ``S_ISREG``, and a reparse point resolving to
    a regular ``.env`` passes ``S_ISREG``. So on a platform with no ``O_NOFOLLOW`` there
    is no sequence of by-name checks that makes this safe, and the honest move is to not
    do it.

    The alternative -- a ctypes ``CreateFileW`` with ``FILE_FLAG_OPEN_REPARSE_POINT`` --
    is declined, and not by me: ``eval/bench/safepath.py`` records that it "is no longer
    worth considering here: it would buy the same property exclusive creation already
    has, at the price of security code that cannot be exercised on the machine this
    harness is developed on", and ``skill_trust.py`` records that Python "does not expose
    an equivalent handle-relative, no-reparse walk on Windows". Both decline the capable
    route, which means this repo has already chosen less capability on that platform over
    a hand-rolled walk. Refusing extends those two decisions; falling back contradicts
    them.

    The cost is not symmetric, which is what makes the trade easy. Refusing loses
    notification HISTORY on one platform for one operation -- the records remain in the
    snapshot and nothing is destroyed. Falling back can put attacker-chosen bytes, a
    credentials file among them, into a location the agent then reads. And this PR exists
    because snapshot restore installed unvalidated bytes: a remaining path that installs
    attacker-chosen bytes is the same defect, closed everywhere except where it is
    hardest.

    The refusal is LOUD and the callers report the skip. A silent skip would be the same
    class of bug as the one being fixed, so the message names the platform, the missing
    primitive, and what was not imported.
