"""Persistent Agent Channels — collaborative multi-agent execution.

A channel is a shared communication space where multiple specialized
agents work on assigned roles, post progress, react to @mentions,
and stay alive until dismissed or timed out.

All agent-to-agent communication goes through the channel (no private
messaging).  The human is the final approver for mutating operations.

# The dispatch verbs: a channel agent may not START work that outlives its own
# confined turn.  Every verb here creates or drives an execution context the
# channel agent does not itself occupy, and that context is NOT confined -- a
# spawned descendant's session key is ``subagent:<id>``, so a containment check
# keyed on a ``channel:`` identity does not recognise the descendant, and the
# descendant holds the full default toolset including every name in the list
# below.  The verbs are therefore refused at the channel agent's OWN hop, where
# its ``channel:`` identity is the one thing already verified.
#
# Per verb: ``spawn_run`` and ``spawn_sub_agents`` create a descendant outright;
# ``spawn_continue`` dispatches a fresh task into an existing run's
# conversation; ``spawn_steer`` injects text a running descendant executes as
# part of its turn; ``workflow_run`` and ``workflow_rerun_subtree`` run an
# orchestration of agents, and ``workflow_author`` exists only to feed them;
# ``task_run`` starts the autonomous task runner; ``register_hook`` opens a
# dedicated agent session an external POST drives later; ``pod_up`` boots a
# whole preview gateway as its own host process on its own port, which keeps
# serving after the turn that started it has ended.
#
# The observe-and-tear-down verbs are deliberately ABSENT, and their absence is
# the qualifier this invariant needs rather than an omission: ``spawn_list``,
# ``spawn_status``, ``spawn_release``, ``workflow_status``, ``workflow_result``,
# ``workflow_list``, ``workflow_cancel``, ``workflow_library_list``,
# ``pod_ls``, ``pod_status`` and ``pod_down`` read or
# end a context that already exists and start no turn.  ``spawn_status`` returns
# a retained transcript, so how widely that read is scoped is a question about
# read scope and not about this boundary.

# behind it, in both directions: stopping one of the user's dashboard sessions

# tool mutates nothing, but containment here is about what crosses the boundary,
# not about who writes — so the exfiltration direction is blocked alongside the
# control one.  CREATE is blocked for a different reason than the other two: it
# writes nothing into an existing conversation, but a session it opened would be
# one the channel agent then owns and may act on, which is exactly the
# containment this list exists to hold.  SEND is the sharpest of the four: stop
# only cancels and read only exfiltrates, but send delivers text that the target

# private dashboard conversation.
