"""Settlement of pending mid-turn steers against a ``steering_consumed`` echo.

Pure and shared by the main chat, the ``/side`` sidecar and channel turns.
Each needs the same answer to "which of these steers did the backend actually
inject?". A second parser would drift, and a wrong answer silently loses a question.

    """Return the entries of *pending* that ``snapshot`` did NOT account for.

    kiro-cli injects the CONCATENATION of every steer queued since the last
    consumption, and the echo carries each one ``<user_message>``-wrapped. KAS does
    not wrap: its ``steering_injected`` frame carries the content verbatim, so that
    echo is a single BARE block. Both shapes are parsed, and settling is by
    EQUALITY either way: substring containment would false-positive a short steer
    against a longer one or against the wrapper text itself, and a falsely-settled
    steer is silently lost when the turn ends.

    Settling is COUNT-AWARE — each block settles at most one pending entry, so a
    duplicate identical steer registered after the snapshot stays pending
    instead of being swept by set membership. An entry registered after kiro-cli
    took its snapshot is simply not among the blocks and stays pending.

    An EMPTY echo (older backend, echo dropped) is no evidence of consumption. By
    default it settles NOTHING: the return value is what stays PENDING, a pending
    steer is requeued when the turn ends, so keeping everything costs at worst a
    visible, cancellable duplicate card, whereas settling on no evidence marks
    steers CONSUMED, suppresses the requeue, and loses the question with no trace.
    A NON-empty echo carrying no envelope is treated as one bare block rather than
    as no evidence, so it settles only the entry it EQUALS -- unrelated prose still
    matches nothing and still settles nothing.
