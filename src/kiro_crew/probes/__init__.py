"""Probes: the domain half of a watch, one module per kind of subject.

A probe answers exactly two questions about one external subject -- *what is it*
(:meth:`~kiro_crew.irq.Probe.identity`) and *what does it look like right now*
(:meth:`~kiro_crew.irq.Probe.observe`) -- and nothing else. Everything generic
lives in :mod:`kiro_crew.irq`: state persistence, per-epoch reset, time-bounded
dedupe, the coalescing window, and the consecutive-failure backstop.

Probes live here rather than beside a driver because a probe outlives its
drivers. The gh-pr probe was written for a script cron and is now also driven
in-process by the auto-nudge scheduler; a probe owned by one driver would have
had to be copied for the second, and two copies of a classifier drift.

#: (``no-new-work-on-gateway-boot-path``: gate the import, not just the handler). The

#: than assumed to be the pull-request one. ``merged`` is the gh-pr probe's; a
#: conductor whose every work item was ACCEPTED has succeeded, and testing only for
#: ``merged`` would persist that success as a blocked outcome.
#:
#: Membership is per OUTCOME, not per kind. The work-ledger probe reports a second,
#: equally terminal key for a ledger whose items are all closed with at least one
#: rejected or abandoned, and that key is absent here on purpose: a goal its
#: conductor rejected did not finish well, and a kind-shaped set would record it as
#: though it had.

#: The work-ledger success key is a LITERAL for the same boot-path reason as

    separately shipped app -- because then no single file can name them all. Both
    kinds live here, no caller outside ``kiro_crew`` adds one, and

    only effect is to move this mapping somewhere a reader has to search for.
