"""Infer WHICH subject a monitor instruction is about, from its own text.

The point of this module is that nothing new has to be passed in. A babysit
instruction already names its subject -- "Babysit PR #42
(kirodotdev/KiroCrew, branch ...)" -- so asking the caller to also supply a
target parameter would add an opt-in, and an opt-in only pays off for the
callers that remember to pass it. Inference has no adoption problem because
there is nothing to adopt.

The whole design leans on one asymmetry. Failing to infer costs a loop that
keeps its existing timer -- today's behaviour, no regression. Inferring the
WRONG subject costs a loop that watches something else: it goes quiet about the
thing it was supposed to watch and wakes about a stranger. So every rule here
refuses on doubt, and the refusal path is the tested one.

#: name is at most 39 characters and a repository name at most 100. Unbounded
#: ``+`` here is a polynomial-ReDoS shape -- a long run of ``-`` with no following

#: pull request besides the URL, which is what makes the URL ambiguous rather than
#: authoritative. Scanning URLs alone is not enough: with no shorthand scan, "drive
#: owner/name#42; blocked on <URL for #7>" gates on the BLOCKER, so #7 merging
#: retires a loop whose own work is #42.
#:
#: The lookbehind refuses a PATH fragment. A babysit instruction routinely cites
#: source locations, and ``src/kiro_crew/autonudge.py#91`` would otherwise read as
#: owner ``kiro_crew`` / repo ``autonudge.py`` / PR 91 -- so it would manufacture

#: subject; it can only show that the instruction is talking about more than one.
#: The literal ``PR``/``pull request`` prefix is what keeps a source location like
#: ``autonudge.py#1751`` from reading as a pull request.
#:
#: The prefix covers a CHAINED list, because "PRs #42 and #7" carries the prefix
#: once and then relies on it: matching only the first number let the second one
#: through unseen, so a loop gated on the URL for #42 retired with the work on #7
