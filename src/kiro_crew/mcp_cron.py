"""MCP server exposing cron tools to kiro-cli.

Runs as ``kirocrew mcp-cron`` — kiro-cli spawns it as a child process
and calls tools via JSON-RPC over stdio (MCP protocol).

Tools:
    cron_list       — list all scheduled jobs
    cron_add        — add a cron job (every/cron/at)
    cron_remove     — remove a job by ID
    cron_remove_all — remove all jobs
    cron_pause      — pause a job
    cron_resume     — resume a paused job
    cron_secret_request — request vault secrets for an owned script cron
                          job (records a PENDING grant; operator approves in
                          the dashboard — this tool never grants)

#   cat ~/.a{w,w}s/creds   expands to a path whose literal text never contains it
#   {1..9}                 sequence form, same hazard with no comma
# Refusing it here makes the guarantee independent of WHICH shell runs the
# command, which is what lets the resolver accept a trusted shell that would
# otherwise expand. Enumerating a re-enable denylist instead (`set -B`,
# `shopt -s braceexpand`) leaks — `eval "set -B"` reaches the same state — so the
# refusal targets the braces, not the switch.
# A NESTED comma form is a real expansion too — `.a{w,{w}}s` -> `.aws .a{w}s`, so
# the first expanded word IS the credential directory — and it becomes reachable
# precisely under this change, since the `+B` probe this ships alongside is what
# admits a brace-expanding bash as the cron executor.
# Whitespace inside the braces is what separates an expansion from an ordinary
# braced argument such as `awk '{print x, y}'`, but only BARE whitespace is: bash
# leaves `{a b,c}` literal and expands every QUOTED or ESCAPED spelling of that
# same space. Which characters those are depends on the quote state each one sits

# expands an unset variable to the empty string, so `cat ~/.ss${UNSET}h/id_rsa`
# reads `.ssh` (verified) while the literal text keeps the name split — and the
# resolver leaves an unknown name literal, so no substitution variant sees it.
# Once local assignments are resolved, any reference STILL present composes a
# string the static scan cannot follow, so it is refused. `$HOME` (and `${HOME}`)

# re-vets an imported job with the raw dict value and that cap does not apply

# bounding the command.

_BRACE_SCAN_STEP_BUDGET = 1_000_000

# The step budget above bounds the WALK. It does not bound the per-character state
# ``_quote_states`` allocates BEFORE the walk starts, and on the uncapped import path
# named above that allocation is itself the attack: two lists of one entry per
# character cost a measured 16.0 bytes/char (flat at n = 1e4, 1e6, 1e7), so a command
# at the 2 GiB ``_MAX_IMPORT_UNCOMPRESSED`` ceiling asks for 32 GiB and the gateway is
# OOM-killed. A kill is not catchable -- ``_sanitize_imported_crons`` wraps this call
# in ``except Exception``, but the kernel sends SIGKILL rather than raising
# ``MemoryError``, so the drop-the-job path never runs.
#
# So the two bounds are complementary rather than alternatives: length bounds the
# allocation, steps bound the walk, and neither substitutes for the other.
#
# The VALUE is set by a second measurement, and it is why this is not simply "far
# above anything legitimate" in the style of ``_CRON_MAX_GLOB_WORD``. The step budget
# bounds the brace walk and nothing else: a single long WORD with no whitespace is
# quadratic through the rules below, independently of that walk, measured at 133 ms
# for 2k, 781 ms for 8k, 11.4 s for 32k and 178 s for 128k, while the brace shape the
# budget does cover stays flat (156 ms -> 269 ms across the same range). That path is
# PRE-EXISTING -- the base commit measures 129 ms / 757 ms / 11.3 s for the same
# inputs, within noise -- so it is not this change's to fix, but it is this ceiling's
# to survive.
#
# Hence a ceiling just above the storable maximum rather than a generous one. A
# ``command`` is capped at 5000 where it is stored, so 8192 leaves ~1.6x headroom for
# a caller with a different cap while holding the worst case under a second (~780 ms
# measured at 8k) and the allocation near 131 KB. At 64 KiB the same quadratic path
# would cost roughly 45 s per call, which is a bound in name only.

def _strip_shell_quotes(command: str) -> str:
    """Return *command* as a NESTED shell receives it, after quote removal.

    ``bash -c "cat ~/.ss{h","h}/x"`` concatenates two double-quoted runs, so the
    comma sits outside both while the braces sit inside — verified, the inner shell
    receives ``cat ~/.ss{h,h}/x`` and prints the expansion. Scanning this projection
    is what catches the spelling where quoting splits one group across several quote
    states.

    Backslash removal is QUOTE-STATE DEPENDENT, because the shell's own quote
    removal is, and getting this wrong in either direction is a hole:

    - **Unquoted** backslash — the shell's escape character. Quote removal deletes
      it, so the inner shell sees the escaped character BARE. Measured:
      ``/bin/sh +B -c '/bin/sh -c "echo "p{x\\,x}q'`` prints ``pxq pxq``, the same
      as the unescaped control, and ``"echo "p\\{x,x}q`` prints it too. Keeping the
      backslash here reads both as separator-free.
    - **Inside double or single quotes** — a backslash before ``{`` or ``,`` is not
      special, so it survives into the inner shell and the word stays literal.
      Measured: ``bash -c 'bash -c "echo \\{a,b\\}"'`` prints ``{a,b}``. Removing it
      here would refuse a group no shell in the chain ever expands.

    Brace expansion runs BEFORE quote removal, which is why an unquoted escape is
    only a separator to a shell that parses the word a SECOND time. Level 1 scans
    the command as written and leaves those literal; this projection is what models
    the second parse, so it is deliberately stricter — see the over-refusal rows in
    ``_BRACE_SHAPES_MEASURED_AGAINST_BASH``.

def _scan_one_level(command: str) -> bool:
    """True when *command* holds a brace expansion at its own parse level.

    Every character's meaning depends on the quote state it sits in, which is not
    a regular property of the surrounding text — hence a scan rather than a
    pattern. The state at the OPENING BRACE is the reference: the closing brace,
    the separator (``,`` or ``..``) and any disqualifying whitespace each count
    only when unescaped and in that same state. Whitespace in a DIFFERENT state is
    nested quoting inside the group, which is precisely the case bash expands.

    Two separate reasons the first ``}`` is not the end of the group, and each is
    load-bearing rather than tidiness — without either, a group reads as
    separator-free and the command is stored:

    - **Nesting is counted.** ``{{x}h,h}`` expands (verified,
      ``echo p{{x}s,s}q`` -> ``p{x}sq psq``), so an inner ``}`` closes the inner
      group, not the outer one. That is what the depth counter is for.
    - **A separator-free ``}`` at depth 0 does not close either.** bash keeps
      hunting for a later ``}`` that does have a depth-0 separator before it and
      treats this one as ordinary text: verified, ``echo p{x},x}q`` ->
      ``px}q pxq``, so the group bash uses is ``{x},x}``. This needs no quoting,
      no escape and no nesting, so it is the cheapest spelling of the three.

    Two edges of the over-approximation, both measured, both refusing rather than
    allowing, and neither modelled here:

    - **Quote state is the quote CHARACTER, not the identity of one quoted run.**
      A group opened inside ``'…'`` skips every byte in a different state — the
      spaces between arguments, and ``|``, ``;``, ``&&`` — and a LATER
      single-quoted region reads as the same state, so it can supply the
      separator and the closing brace. That refuses
      ``awk '{print}' f | grep ',}'`` and ``jq -c '{a:.b}' f | sed 's/,/}/'``,
      which bash leaves literal at both levels. It needs one more ``}`` than
      ``{`` and a later ``,``, which is what keeps the class narrow; a realistic
      corpus including ``docker ps --format '{{.ID}},{{.Names}}'`` is unaffected,
      because a trailing ``}}`` decrements depth and never reaches a depth-0 close.
    - **bash declines the retry when the word STARTS with ``{}``**: ``{},}`` is
      literal while ``a{},}b`` expands. This scan refuses both.

    The rule is measured against real bash, not read off the grammar. Every row
    below was run; the middle column is what bash actually did::

        {x,'x x'}    EXPANDS   same, single quotes
        {x,$'x x'}   EXPANDS   same, ANSI-C quoting

        {"x","x x"}  EXPANDS   comma between two quoted words
        {{x}h,h}     EXPANDS   nested group, separator only at depth 0
        {x,x\\x0cy}   EXPANDS   form feed, vertical tab, CR and NBSP all do
        {x,x x}      literal   a BARE space breaks it
        {x,x<TAB>x}  literal   same for tab and newline, and ONLY those
        {x","x}      literal   a quoted comma is not a separator HERE...
        {x\\,x}       literal   same, escaped
        \\{x,x\\}      literal   escaped braces
        '{'x,x'}'    literal   quoted braces

    ...but the last three rows are about THIS parse level only, and the string
    reaches more than one parser. Two levels are therefore scanned, and either one
    refuses:

    1. the command as written, for the shell that runs the cron;
    2. the command with quote delimiters removed, which is what a nested shell
       receives — verified, ``bash -c "cat ~/.ss{h","h}/x"`` hands the inner shell
       ``cat ~/.ss{h,h}/x``, which expands. The separator there sits OUTSIDE the
       quotes while the braces sit inside, so no single-level rule can see it.

    The DOUBLE-quoted spellings in the table are refused for cause, not merely out
    of caution: verified, ``p{x","x}s`` and ``p"{"x,x"}"s`` both reach an inner
    shell as ``p{x,x}s`` and expand there. The genuine over-refusal is the SINGLE-
    quoted group, because single quotes survive one level of double-quoted nesting —
    verified, the inner shell receives them intact and leaves the group literal.

    THE COST, STATED PLAINLY, because it is larger than "a contrived shape". Nothing
    on the base branch refuses a bash brace expansion at all, so every refusal here
    is new, and the class users will actually hit is not ``awk '{a,b}'`` but the
    quoted regex INTERVAL: ``grep -E '[0-9]{1,3}'``, ``sed -E 's/x{2,4}//'``. Those
    are refused, and ``portability.py``'s import path re-vets with this same
    function and DROPS a job it refuses, so an exported job carrying one is not
    importable. The drop is audited rather than silent, which is the only thing that
    makes it acceptable.

    An accurate remedy exists for BRE tools and is named in the error text:
    ``grep "[0-9]\\{1,3\\}"`` is accepted — a backslash inside DOUBLE quotes escapes
    the brace for this scan and is passed through to the tool, where BRE reads
    ``\\{m,n\\}`` as the interval (verified both halves). It is not a remedy for ERE,
    where ``\\{`` means a literal brace, so an ERE interval belongs in a ``script``
    job. Refusing rather than enumerating which commands re-parse their arguments is
    deliberate: an enumeration of shell-invoking spellings (``sh -c``, ``xargs``,
    ``find -exec``, ``env``, ``timeout``, ``busybox``…) fails OPEN on the one nobody
    listed, and this scan is the only rule covering that class.

    The common shapes are unaffected: ``awk '{print x, y}'`` and
    ``jq '{a: .x, b: .y}'`` survive quote removal with their bare spaces intact.

    """Scan a cron SCRIPT body for credential-exfiltration patterns.

    A ``cron_add`` ``script`` job points at a file under ``~/.kiro/crew/crons/``
    that the agent itself can write (via its file-write tool) and then register.
    ``resolve_script_path`` validates only the *path*, so without this the body
    is never inspected. An ungranted script runs under ``mode="cc"`` and a
    secret-granted one under ``strict``. ``cc`` hides the credential stores on
    Linux; on macOS it deliberately leaves ``~/.aws`` readable (it is the
    Claude Code provider's tier, and that provider authenticates to Bedrock
    through ``credential_process`` under ``~/.aws``), and Windows has no OS
    sandbox backend at all. So a body that names ``~/.aws/credentials`` or
    ``os.environ["AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY"]`` and POSTs it out is worth refusing
    at storage time rather than relying on one runtime control alone.
    Credential exfiltration -- which a human rubber-stamping the ``cron_add``
    approval prompt would not catch -- is the threat this gate closes.

    The body is PYTHON SOURCE, not a shell command line, so it is scanned only with
    the detectors that are meaningful on source text and are all linear, whole-body
    matches: a credential-path spelling anywhere (``_CRON_CRED_PATH_RE``), a
    protected secret env var by ``$NAME`` or bare name (``_CRON_SECRET_ENV_RE`` /
    ``_CRON_SECRET_NAME_RE``), and an exfiltration URL (``scan_exfiltration_urls``).

    It is deliberately NOT handed to ``is_denied`` or ``is_sensitive_bash_command``.
    Both read their subject with shell grammar -- tool-name globs like ``*git*push*``,
    separator-run collapse (in source a backslash run is an ESCAPE), newline-split
    pipeline stages under a fail-closed budget (every line of a script counted as a
    stage, so ~512 lines is a permanent refusal), ordered-existence ``env | grep``
    rules matching pieces hundreds of lines apart, and a ``find``-grammar parse of
    English docstrings. Each produces a class of false denial on ordinary scripts,
    each closeable only by another layer of AST analysis in
    ``security.py``, and ~1500 lines of that still cannot stop
    ``open(os.environ["LOCALAPPDATA"] + r"\\kiro-cli\\config.json")``: static text
    analysis of a Turing-complete body cannot be the fence. The runtime control for
    what a script may OPEN is the sandbox ``run_script`` spawns it in (``wrap_argv``
    bind-masks the crew home's credential leaves, the vault and the keystone in
    ``cc`` mode, and ``strict`` for a secret-granted run); this gate stops the
    obvious register-a-malicious-script case and nothing more. Destructive-op risk is covered by the required ``cron_add``
    approval prompt.

    ``_vet_script_file`` keeps its own ``sensitive_path_refusal`` on the resolved path.

    holds back ``send_*``, every ``session_*`` verb, and every verb that starts
    work outside the caller's own turn, for exactly that reason.
    Scheduling a cron job is the same shape made durable: ``cron_add`` takes an
    ``agent`` and ``approval_mode`` that flow straight to ``add_job``, so a
    channel agent could schedule ``agent="kirocrew", approval_mode="auto"`` and
    have a full-tool agent run on the gateway host on a timer -- an escalation
    past its own confinement that outlives both the turn and the channel.
    ``cron_update`` maps ``agent`` onto ``agent_id``, so it re-targets the agent
    of a job the calling session already owns.

    The interactive guard in ``channel.py`` rejects blocked tools at the
    permission-request event, but an AUTO-APPROVED call fires no such event: an
    ``@kirocrew-cron/cron_add`` entry in a channel agent's ``allowedTools`` is
    translated to a KAS auto-approve permission (``acp/kas_permissions.py``;
    MCP tools are not in ``WITHHELD_FROM_AUTO_APPROVE``), and auto-approval is
    the ABSENCE of a permission request -- so ``_blocked_tool_named`` never runs.
    The containment therefore has to hold HERE, at MCP dispatch, keyed on the
    verified caller identity (the strict resolver refuses forgeable sources).
    Mirrors ``mcp_core._deny_channel_agent_messaging``.

    Only the ``channel:`` orchestrator-agent namespace is confined; a

    """Why the row just written may already be unmanageable, or ``""``.

    ``cron_add`` stamps the CALLER's key as the owner and every mutating tool then
    demands an exact match, so a caller whose own key does not outlive the job has
    just written a row only ``kirocrew cron adopt`` can rescue. Both branches below
    succeed today and report a bare success, which is the defect: the loss is
    silent at the one moment the caller still has the id in front of it and could
    act.

    A WARNING appended to a success, deliberately, not a refusal. A sub-agent
    scheduling a job nobody ever pauses is a working flow -- only management is
    lost, never execution -- so refusing would break callers who are getting
    exactly what they asked for, to protect them from a cost they may not be
    paying. Naming the consequence costs those callers one sentence and tells the
    ones who DID intend to manage the job what to do while it is still cheap.

    Every ``cron adopt`` reference here is addressed to the USER, in the same
    ``Tell the user:`` register the success string already uses. That is not a
    style choice: ``security.py``'s ``self-protection-cron-adopt`` rule denies the
    command to the agent outright, precisely so a session cannot assign itself
    ownership of a scheduled job. An instruction telling the model to RUN it would
    dead-end at that gate and read as a malfunction, so the model is told to relay
    it instead -- the human is the only principal who can execute the remedy, and
    the deny rule and this text now point the same way.

    Neither branch is reachable from the surfaces that already work: a chat tab is
    ``dashboard:<slot>`` and a durable cron is ``cron:<job_id>``, and both outlive
    the jobs they create.

    Distinct from :func:`_owner_unusable_caveat`, which is about the caller. Here

    ``persistent_session=False`` gives each run a fresh ``cron:<id>:<run_id>`` key
    (``cron.build_cron_session_context``), so that job can never satisfy an
    ownership check on a later run -- including against jobs it created itself on
    an earlier one.

    Two exemptions, both because the flag cannot produce the bad state:

    * NOT an agent job. A script cron is launched with
      ``KIROCREW_SESSION_KEY=cron:<job_id>`` unconditionally and a command cron
      issues no MCP call at all.
    * a dispatching ``agent_sequence`` (:func:`cron.agent_sequence_dispatches`,
      the one spelling of that gate). That path mints a stable
      ``cron:<job_id>:<agent>`` key and ignores ``persistent_session``, so the
      warning would be false -- the same conflation
      :func:`cron.cron_session_key_is_stable` exists to prevent.

    Applied at ``cron_update`` as well as ``cron_add``: the flag is writable on
    both, so warning only at creation would leave the identical state reachable
    through a bare ``Updated job:``.

    The argument reads as a context-management knob -- whether a run sees the
    previous run's transcript -- and nothing at the call site suggests it also
    revokes the job's authority over the scheduler. That gap is why this is worth
