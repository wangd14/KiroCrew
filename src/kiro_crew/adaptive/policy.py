"""``AdaptivePolicy``: the deterministic AIMD state machine (RFC §5.2).

Pure. It reads :class:`~.signals.Sample` objects (each carrying its own
timestamp) and returns :class:`Decision` objects; it owns no clock, no task, no
socket. The controller in :mod:`.controller` is the only thing that acts on a
decision, and the tests drive the policy with hand-built samples.

Two tracks, one verdict. The gateway's execution cap (subagent spawns) and the
daemon's spawn gate (backend forks) have different bounds -- ``min(user_max, 4)``
/ 1 / ``user_max`` and 4 / 1 / 8 -- but they move on the same pressure verdict,
because both describe how many cold starts this HOST can absorb at once. Each
track earns its increases on its own evidence (completions for the exec track,
successful backend inits for the gate) and only when demand is actually at its
limit, so an idle track never drifts up.

Rules, with fixed tuning constants owned by this module:

* **Decrease** (multiplicative). Only on CORROBORATED pressure: a signal that
  is sufficient alone (loop lag >= 250 ms, memory <= critical) or at least two
  distinct signals in one sample (timeouts + slow starts, fds + gate failures,
  ...). Target ``max(ceil(cap * 0.5), healthy_in_flight)``, at most ``cap - 1``,
  never below the floor: halving is the lower bound, but a cut below the work
  that is currently succeeding frees nothing (nothing is ever killed) and would
  only be undone. That is what turns 10 concurrent starts with 4 timing out
  into 6, then 4. Cooldown 30 s between decreases; the successes counted
  before a decrease are discarded on the track that was cut, and only there
  -- a track already at its floor keeps the successes it has earned.
* **Increase**. Two regimes, one rule each, and the bound is the user's
  configured ceiling (``exec_ceiling``: an explicit ``max_subagents``, or the
  memory-sized auto cap when it is 0). No static host prediction sits under
  that ceiling: the point of the loop is to let many sessions ask for many
  workers, admit them up to the ceiling, and QUEUE and back off on the live
  pressure signals below (memory under the pressure line, loop lag, timeouts)
  rather than pin the cap at a number guessed from peak readings. Memory is
  the one resource whose over-commit is unrecoverable, and it is guarded
  live: an increase needs a MEASURED free-memory reading at or above the
  pressure line (an unreadable host, ``free_mem_mb < 0``, fails open here as
  it does for the spawn gate's own guard), a decrease fires at the critical
  line, and the spawn gate defers every cold start that would not leave
  ``spawn_min_memory_gb`` plus the running agents' unobserved growth free.

  * **Slow start**, until this process meets its first corroborated pressure or
    pause: ``x2`` per clean sample window (``slow_start_clean_secs``, 5 s),
    once ``slow_start_successes`` (1) completions land and demand is at the
    cap. A fresh gateway therefore reaches the host's own figure in a handful
    of windows: a flat ``+1`` per ``increase_clean_secs`` (30 s) window from
    the fresh-start 4 to a 64 ceiling is 60 windows, i.e. 30 minutes of clean
    samples.
  * **Congestion avoidance**, afterwards: ``+1`` per ``increase_clean_secs``
    (30 s) window, once demand is at the cap and enough work has landed:
    ``min(increase_successes, cap)`` completions on the exec track -- one full
    wave of the CURRENT cap -- and ``increase_successes`` on the gate, whose
    counter is backend inits rather than finished runs. Scaling the exec bar to
    the CAP is what makes the first step off a floored cap affordable: a flat 20
    made ``1 -> 2`` cost twenty serial runs, so a cap cut to the floor stayed
    there.

  Both regimes also require the sample to be clear on the hysteresis side
  (lag < 100 ms, memory >= pressure line, no signal at all) and at least one
  window since the last pressure. An idle track never drifts up PAST the
  fresh-start cap.
* **Idle recovery**. A cut is evidence about the work that was running when
  it fired. Once the exec track has had no demand at all (nothing running or
  queued) and the host no pressure signal for ``idle_recovery_secs`` (60 s),
  that evidence is stale, yet the earn rules above can never retire it: they
  need demand at the cap and completions, and an idle track -- or one whose
  load runs on the runner lane (workflow ``ctx.agent()`` calls, TaskRunner
  steps), which the exec track does not count -- produces neither. So a cap
  below the fresh-start value climbs ``+1`` per clean window while that holds,
  and a pause whose probe never reported (nothing ran, or it ran where no
  completion is counted) resumes at ``floor + 1`` (never above the fresh-start
  cap). The bound is the fresh-start
  cap, ``min(user_max, adaptive_initial)``: a drained process never holds MORE
  untested concurrency than a restart would, and everything above it is still
  earned. Any signal restarts the idle clock; the next corroborated pressure
  cuts again.
* **Pause and probe**. Severe pressure (memory below critical, or loop lag
  beyond 2 s) for two consecutive samples pauses dispatch: the exec cap goes
  to 0 grants and the gate to its floor. Running work is untouched. Once the
  severe condition clears, one probe is admitted (exec cap 1); when that probe
  completes without pressure the caps return to ``floor + 1`` and normal AIMD
  resumes. A probe that meets corroborated pressure re-pauses.
* **Provider throttling** never reaches the host caps. Throttled scopes are
  reported on the decision for the dependency coordinator (area L).
* **Fresh start** is ``min(user_max, 4)``; the process earns its way up.
* **Why the cap is low** is on the snapshot: ``last_cut`` is the decision that
  last lowered the exec cap (action, reason, signals, sample time), and a hold
  names what the next increase is waiting for (demand at the cap, completions,
  or the idle clock).
* ``mode == "fixed"`` returns the initial caps forever (Q2 reversal).
