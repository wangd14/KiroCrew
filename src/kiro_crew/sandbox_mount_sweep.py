"""Reclaim the bind-mount sources the Linux namespace launcher leaves on tmpfs.

The launcher stages an empty directory or file for every path it masks, named
``kirocrew_sb_<pid>_...`` on a tmpfs root, and binds it over the target. The kernel
pins a source for its mount's lifetime, so the launcher cannot remove it and it
orphans when the sandboxed process exits; left alone the pile exhausts the session
runtime tmpfs. This module decides which of those entries are provably ours and no
longer bound by any live mount namespace, and removes only those:

- :func:`_mount_pinned_source_names` reads every readable task's mountinfo to find
  the sources a live namespace still binds, and reports through
  :class:`_PinScanCoverage` whether every task that could hold one was read;
- :func:`_cleanup_stale_sandbox_mount_sources` reclaims pid-keyed entries whose pid
  is dead or past the age backstop, by kind;
- :func:`_cleanup_legacy_mount_source_residue` reclaims the older pid-less residue;
- :func:`_cleanup_retired_acp_snapshot_dir` removes a retired snapshot directory.

``kiro_crew.sandbox.cleanup_stale_sandbox_profiles`` runs them after its own sweep of
launcher scripts and profiles. ``kiro_crew.sandbox`` re-exports every name here, and a
patch through it lands here, which is how the test floor keeps the sweep off the
host's real ``/run/user``, ``/dev/shm`` and ``/proc``.

    """Entry names of sandbox mount sources referenced by a live mount, plus
    whether the scan positively covered every namespace a PROCESS could be
    binding one from.

    A bind mount records its source as the ``root`` field (field 4) of a
    ``/proc/<pid>/mountinfo`` line, and the staged sources are direct children
    of a tmpfs root, so the basename of that field is the staged entry's name
    (mkdtemp names carry no spaces, so mountinfo's octal escaping never
    applies to them). Only prefix-shaped basenames are collected — a foreign
    mount whose root merely resembles a path cannot pin anything. Keying is by
    basename, so two identically-named entries on different roots would share
    a pin; mkdtemp's random suffix makes that vanishingly rare, and the error
    lands on the retention side.

    The launcher's mounts live in the sandboxed child's PRIVATE namespace —
    invisible in the gateway's own mountinfo — and that namespace can outlive
    the launcher pid through any surviving descendant (a build daemon, for
    example), so every readable pid's mountinfo is consulted. Coverage is
    what makes the answer usable, and it is established positively:

    - The listing must show pid 1. ``hidepid``/``subset=pid`` procfs hides
      other users' processes entirely — including a root holder that entered
      a sandbox namespace — and pid 1 always exists, so its absence proves
      the listing is filtered and the scan reports incomplete. It still reads
      every pid the filtered listing DOES show (this uid's own processes are
      never hidden from it, and every sandbox descendant keeps this uid), so
      the pins a visible holder contributes reach the caller regardless: the
      directory gate honours ``pinned`` before any other evidence.
    - A holder can fork a successor and exit between the pid listing and its
      own mountinfo read (the read then raises FileNotFoundError). The
      successor was forked BEFORE the exit, so it is visible to the very next
      listing: the scan re-lists after any pass that observed a vanish, and
      finishes on a pass that saw none. A pid appearing WITHOUT a vanish
      needs no rescan — it is either in a namespace whose surviving holders
      this scan already read, or in a brand-new namespace, which can only
      bind brand-new (fresh, live-pid) entries that are never reclaim
      candidates in the same sweep. A scan still churning after
      ``_PIN_SCAN_MAX_PASSES`` cannot prove coverage and reports incomplete.
      (A successor recycled onto an already-seen pid NUMBER inside this
      window escapes the re-listing; that needs the full pid space to wrap
      within the scan's milliseconds, and the residual error is
      retention-side only on the next sweep.)
    - A read failure is forgiven in two cases and counts as a coverage gap
      otherwise. ``EINVAL`` says that TASK has no ``nsproxy``, which is not yet
      a statement about the NAMESPACE: a thread-group leader can exit through
      ``pthread_exit`` while sibling threads keep running, and threads share the
      nsproxy, so a live namespace can sit behind a zombie leader while
      ``proc_root`` — which lists only leaders — shows nothing else to scan. So
      the group is consulted through ``/proc/<pid>/task/<tid>/mountinfo``, with
      exactly two outcomes per sibling and no third: one that READS contributes
      pins and nothing else, and one that does not read, for ANY reason,
      makes coverage unprovable. Departed siblings are counted rather than
      excused, because one exiting between the listing and its read may have
      spawned a successor THREAD first, and a thread is invisible to the outer
      re-listing (which enumerates thread-group leaders only), so no re-listing
      can recover it. Tasks in one group can also hold DIFFERENT mount
      namespaces, since a thread may ``unshare(CLONE_NEWNS)``, so a readable
      sibling never speaks for an unreadable one. When every sibling reads, the
      leader's own departure still makes this a vanish, because a departing task
      may have handed its namespace to a PROCESS forked after this pass's
      listing and only a re-listing can see that. A LIVE leader that could be a
      holder (this uid's, the overflow uid's, root's) has its siblings read the
      same way, since a thread can ``unshare(CLONE_FS)`` + ``setns`` into a
      namespace its leader is not in; a sibling that departed mid-read has its
      whole group re-read on the next pass, one that would not read for any
      other reason makes coverage unprovable. Any OTHER errno on the leader
      is forgiven only when the pid provably belongs to a DIFFERENT real user
      (its ``/proc/<pid>`` stats to a uid that is not ours, not root, and not
      the host's overflow uid) — such a process cannot be binding a source this
      uid staged, because the sandboxed child keeps this uid and NO_NEW_PRIVS.
      Root can enter any namespace, and a holder in a foreign user namespace
      stats as the overflow uid, so those count as coverage gaps.

    A namespace held only by an nsfs fd or a bind-mounted ``ns/mnt`` — zero
    member processes — has no mountinfo to scan and is out of scope; the
    launcher never creates one. ``complete=False`` means absence-of-pin was
    NOT established host-wide. When the caller passes ``coverage``, the scan
    also answers the narrower question the directory gate needs
    (:class:`_PinScanCoverage`): whether every task that could be a launcher
    descendant — this uid's and the overflow uid's — was read, with none
    departing between the final listing and its read. Root's tasks count as
    possible holders too (root can ``nsenter`` any namespace), so a hidden or
    unreadable root task — a filtered procfs included — lowers coverage along
    with ``complete``; another user's unreadable or departing task lowers only
    ``complete``.

def _cleanup_stale_sandbox_mount_sources(*, roots: Sequence[str] | None = None) -> int:
    """Reclaim orphaned bind-mount sources staged by the namespace launcher.

    The launcher stages one empty dir per SENSITIVE_DIRS entry, one empty file
    per SENSITIVE_FILES entry, and (strict only) an SSH shadow dir holding a
    known-hosts copy, all named ``kirocrew_sb_<pid>_*`` on a tmpfs root. The
    kernel pins each source while its bind-mount lives, so the launcher cannot
    remove them and they orphan when the sandboxed process exits. Left alone
    they exhaust the runtime tmpfs (``/run/user/$UID``), at which point the
    systemd user manager cannot allocate transient scope units and every
    ``systemd-run --scope``-wrapped spawn fails.

    An entry becomes a reclaim candidate when its embedded pid is dead, or
    past ``_MOUNT_SOURCE_MAX_AGE_SECONDS`` (the backstop for a pid recycled
    onto an unrelated live process — routine on a ``pid_max=32768`` host).
    What a candidate's removal may touch is then decided by kind, because a
    bind source is NOT protected by the kernel against the sweeper: removing
    it succeeds from this namespace (mountinfo then shows ``//deleted``), a
    removed source DIRECTORY leaves the live mount's root inode ``S_DEAD`` so
    every create under the masked path fails from then on, and a non-empty
    dir's contents are visible inside any namespace still binding it:

    - Plain files: ``os.remove``. A file source's inode is held by the mount
      like an open descriptor, so the masked view is unaffected.
    - Dirs, empty or not: removed only when no readable mount namespace
      references the entry (:func:`_mount_pinned_source_names`) AND absence
      of a pin is positively established — by the scan proving it covered
      every namespace on the host, OR by it having read every task that
      could hold one (:class:`_PinScanCoverage`: this uid's, the overflow
      uid's and root's tasks, none unreadable, none departed between the
      final listing and its read). The second is what this fix adds. The
      host-wide flag also drops for another user's unreadable or departing
      task, which cannot be holding a source this uid staged (the sandboxed
      child keeps this uid with NO_NEW_PRIVS; only root can enter a foreign
      namespace), and requiring it alone is what stranded the directory
      class permanently on the hosts this sweep exists for (observed:
      929,540 dirs retained against 511 files reclaimed, the runtime tmpfs
      back at 100% of its inodes and every spawn failing again). A recycled
      pid reads live yet has no mount, so its entry is still reclaimed after
      the age backstop rather than stranded, while a genuine long-lived
      sandbox is pinned by its own process. A namespace no PROCESS holds has
      no mountinfo to report a pin — an fd- or bind-pinned namespace with
      zero members is out of scope, and the launcher never creates one — so
      the pin set cannot go stale in the deleting direction. The
      fresh-and-alive skip above stays load-bearing for the launcher's own
      staging window (after ``mkdtemp``, before ``mount``), when its entries
      are legitimately live and not yet pinned.

    Deliberately conservative about names: only the recognized
    ``kirocrew_sb_<pid>_`` shape with an ASCII positive pid is touched.
    Foreign ``tmp*`` names carry no liveness key and are left alone, as are
    ``kirocrew_sandbox_*`` launcher scripts, the ``kirocrew_sbprobe_*`` tmpfs
    probe, and prefix matches whose segment is not an ASCII positive decimal
    (an oversized all-digit segment IS the recognized shape — it probes
    OverflowError, reads stale, and is reclaimed). Some of these roots are
    world-writable, so a planted entry — including a deep tree built to make
    ``rmtree`` recurse — must fail toward "skip", never toward an exception
    that kills the sweep.

    so the gateway's first cleanup pass heals the host without an operator ever
    learning what ``Failed to start transient scope unit: No space left on
    device`` meant.

    An unkeyed name cannot be PROVEN to be ours, so every fence here is about
    keeping a stranger's entry rather than reclaiming ours:

    - only on the session runtime tmpfs the launcher picks first
      (:func:`_launcher_tmpfs_roots`), never ``/dev/shm`` or the shared system
      tempdir, where another same-uid program's ``tempfile`` scratch lives —
      and when no such root is PRESENT the pass returns before the pin scan,
      because there is nowhere for an entry of this class to be;
    - only ``tempfile``'s exact shape (:data:`_LEGACY_MOUNT_SOURCE_RE`);
    - only DIRECTORIES owned by THIS uid with the exact mode ``mkdtemp``
      creates (0o700) — a hand-made or umask-shaped entry is not one of
      these, and the old build's ``mkstemp`` file sources are left alone: an
      unlinked file another program still holds open loses what it writes
      next, which no fence here can rule out, while an empty dir holds
      nothing to lose;
    - only past ``_MOUNT_SOURCE_MAX_AGE_SECONDS``, which every real member of
      this class is by construction (nothing creates the shape now) while a
      live program's scratch dir usually is not;
    - only when no live mount names the entry as its source, and only when
      that absence was POSITIVELY established (:func:`_bound_source_basenames`
      complete, or every possible holder read — the same two claims as the
      keyed dir gate, since ``/run/user/$UID`` is reachable by this uid and
      root alone);
    - only once a root shows the PILE this pass exists for
      (:data:`_LEGACY_PILE_THRESHOLD` candidates passing every fence above):
      a stray scratch dir or two never trips it and is retained outright,
      while the leak class arrives by the hundred thousand;
    - dirs go through ``os.rmdir``, which REFUSES a non-empty directory: that
      is the emptiness fence, so a populated stranger's dir survives without a
      listing, and so does the legacy SSH shadow dir (it holds a known-hosts
      copy) — left for the human note in the issue rather than removed here;
    - the one-shot marker is stamped only by a pass that reached the end AND
      found nothing retained for age alone, so a host upgrading within a day
      of its last old-build spawn does not retire the pass on that cohort.

    Returns:
        Number of entries removed.
