"""The cron store on disk: ``crons.json``'s format, its lock, and what a record may hold.

    loop catches ``(OSError, ValueError, TypeError, sqlite3.Error)`` per item; a
    ``RuntimeError`` escaped that tuple, so ONE corrupt ``crons.json`` failed the
    whole apply request with a 500 and lost every later item in the plan, instead
    of rejecting the single schedule it actually blocks. The three sites that
    catch both classes list ``CronStoreUnreadable`` BEFORE ``ValueError``, so they
    keep binding their own arm and their messages do not change.

    Raised by :meth:`CronService._save` when ``_load`` could not read

    write that never happened. Background writers (the reaper merge, the job

    (:meth:`CronService._load`) isolates that failure to THIS entry — one bad
    record must never discard the rest of the store.

    Field-type handling splits by what a wrong type would cost:

    - **Required identity/payload** (``id``, ``name``, ``message``,

      ``agent_id``, plus the ``agent_sequence`` / ``skip_dates`` lists) raise

      Coercing a selector instead would fail OPEN: a script job whose
      ``script`` degraded to ``""`` silently becomes an LLM agent job
      (``_cron_callback`` picks the mode from which selector is non-empty),
      executing the job's message through the default agent — worse than not
      loading the record at all.
    - **Everything else string-typed** coerces to the field's own unset value
      (``""``, or ``None`` for ``Optional[str]`` fields), and every field
      whose stored value was destroyed by that coercion is named in one
      WARNING, because ``_save`` rewrites ``jobs[]`` wholesale and the coerced
      value replaces the operator's stored one on the next write — the log
      line is the recovery window, exactly like the skip warning in ``_load``.

    It does NOT raise ``AttributeError`` for any record ``json.loads`` can
    produce: every ``.get()`` below is dominated by a ``[...]`` subscript on the
    same object, and only a ``dict`` survives a string subscript. An
    ``AttributeError`` from this function therefore signals a defect in this
    code, not bad data, so :meth:`CronService._load` deliberately lets it
    propagate rather than catching it: catching it there would reclassify a
    valid job as malformed, and because ``_save`` rewrites ``jobs[]`` from
    ``self._jobs`` the next write would erase that job from disk permanently —
    turning a code defect into silent, unrecoverable data loss. Letting it

    """Read *path*, returning ``(records, loadable)``. NEVER raises.

    ``loadable`` is False only when the store is PRESENT but the scheduler can
    build nothing from it. It exists for the DIAGNOSTIC caller, which must tell
    "you have no crons" (fine) from "your crons stopped loading" (a fault);
    runtime readers take ``[0]`` and keep degrading quietly, so the records
    half is unchanged by it.

    Single owner of the read-parse-shape prologue for the three readers that
    deliberately bypass the scheduler so they work with no running gateway
    (:func:`referenced_skill_names`, :func:`unhealthy_jobs_from_disk`,
    :meth:`CronService.count_enabled_from_disk`). Each had grown its own
    spelling of this prologue and they had drifted in WHICH corruption they
    survived, so a store that one reader shrugged off crashed another. This is
    NOT every reader of the file — see the exclusions below.

    Every failure mode collapses to "no records", because all three callers
    degrade quietly by contract rather than propagate:

    * ``OSError`` — no file at all (every fresh install), permissions, or a
      directory where the file should be.
    * ``UnicodeError`` — the store is bytes on disk and can hold invalid
      UTF-8. Reading with an explicit encoding also pins the decode to the
      one :func:`~kiro_crew.atomic_write.atomic_write` writes, rather than to
      the caller's locale.
    * ``ValueError`` / ``TypeError`` — unparseable JSON.
    * ``RecursionError`` — deeply nested JSON. It subclasses ``RuntimeError``,
      NOT ``ValueError``, so it escapes a decode-error tuple and would abort
      the caller from inside the read it expected to be safe.
    * Shape — a document that parses but is not an object holding a ``jobs``
      list (a top-level ``[]``, a scalar, ``{"jobs": null}``).

    Non-dict entries are dropped here so that no caller repeats the check.
    All three already discarded them — two by an explicit ``isinstance``
    guard, one by letting :func:`_job_from_record` reject them — so
    filtering centrally preserves each caller's behaviour exactly.

    Three readers are deliberately NOT served, because each owes the user or
    the scheduler a louder reaction than a quiet degrade:

    * :meth:`CronService._load` reads bytes handed over by ``_sync``, logs a
      warning naming the corruption, and resets the store fingerprint — those
      are scheduler-state side effects folding in here would silence.
    * :func:`~kiro_crew.portability._sanitize_imported_crons` rewrites an
      unreadable import to an empty store and reports it to the caller.
    * :func:`~kiro_crew.snapshot._merge_crons` prints which path it could not
      read, skips the merge, and answers ``False`` so its caller can report
      the refusal instead of a success.

    The latter two still guard on ``(OSError, ValueError)`` only, so a deeply
    nested store aborts an import or a snapshot merge there. That is a real
    remaining gap, left for separate work: both owe the user a message naming
    the file, which this quiet loader cannot give them.
