"""Client affinity for Slack deliveries that outlive a Reconnect.

``POST /api/slack/reconnect`` replaces the gateway's live Web API client
(``GatewayOrchestrator.slack``) while work started under the previous client
may still be in flight: a turn awaiting its agent, an approval card waiting
for the owner's click, a modal about to be updated. Every destination that
work holds -- channel id, thread ``ts``, message ``ts`` -- was minted by the
workspace the OLD client reached. Sent through the new client after a switch
to another workspace it is lost (``channel_not_found``) or, on a colliding
id, misrouted.

The receiving side already binds the routing of a message to the client that
received it (``_route_message``'s ``received_by``, the queue entry's client).
This module closes the rest: the client an envelope arrived through is bound
to the TASK CONTEXT of that envelope, and ``GatewayOrchestrator.slack``
resolves to the bound client whenever one is set. ``asyncio.create_task``
copies the context, so every task spawned while handling the envelope --
the interactive dispatch, the slash command, the agent turn and its final
post -- keeps answering through the client that received it, however many
reconnects happen meanwhile. Code that runs outside any envelope (the HTTP
routes, boot, cron) sees the live client as before.

Deliberately strict: a bound delivery never falls back to the live client,
even for a same-workspace token rotation, because nothing here can tell a
rotation from a switch without a network round trip, and the failure of a
post through a revoked token is visible (the Web API says so) where a post
into the wrong workspace is not.

The AUTHORIZATION SUBJECT travels the same way. ``slack.handler`` keeps the
owner id (the only authorized Slack user) as a module global that a Reconnect
rebinds from the credential store, and a turn reads it many awaits after its
envelope arrived (``is_allowed_user`` after a Web API call, after queueing).
An envelope received under workspace A's owner and resumed after a Reconnect
to workspace B would otherwise be authorized against B's owner -- and a
sender id that happens to equal B's owner's (Slack ids are per workspace;
nothing prevents the collision, and the W/U prefix cross-match widens it)
would hold owner privileges in A's thread. So the owner the socket was
built with is bound to each envelope's context beside its client
(``owner_scope``), and ``is_owner`` resolves the bound owner whenever one is
set; a queued turn carries it in its queue entry like the client.

What is bound is a REVOCABLE authority (``SocketAuthority``), one per socket,
not the owner string: a Reconnect whose close of the former socket fails or
times out keeps that socket referenced and de-authorizes through the module
globals, and a binding that outranked those globals would let the surviving
listener keep authorizing the former owner on every envelope it still
delivers. Revoking the socket's authority reaches every envelope bound to it,
queued turns included, in one step.
