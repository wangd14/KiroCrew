"""Slack Enterprise Grid workspace validation (default-open).

Optionally restricts the bot to specific Enterprise Grid workspaces when
an operator configures ``slack.allowed_enterprise_ids``.  With no
allowlist configured (the default), all workspaces are accepted — this
is an opt-in restriction, not a hardcoded one.

Two layers of defence:
1. ``validate_enterprise()`` at gateway startup — calls ``auth.test``,
   caches the validated ``team_id``, and (when an allowlist is
   configured) blocks workspaces outside the allowlist.
2. ``check_message_origin()`` on every incoming message — compares the
   event's ``team`` field against the cached value (zero-cost in-memory
   check, no API call).  Catches hot-swap of ``.env`` tokens while the
   gateway is running.  Allows everything when no allowlist is set.

    * :func:`validate_enterprise` compares ``enterprise_id or team_id``, so on
      Enterprise Grid an org-level ``E…`` entry satisfies startup and the boot

    * :func:`check_message_origin` compares the event's workspace id --

    Deliberately DIAGNOSTIC.  It admits nothing extra and narrows nothing:
    quietly treating an ``E…`` entry as org-wide admission would widen a
    security allowlist whose whole purpose is keeping another Grid workspace
    out, and this module refuses every other silent widening for the same
    reason.  The remedy is the operator's, so the message names it.

    Silent when the operator ALSO listed workspace ids: the ``E…`` entry is then
    redundant rather than load-bearing, inbound works, and warning every boot

    **One reader.** The same validated read decides BOTH "is this config
    usable" and "what is the allowlist", so the two answers can never
    disagree.  Asking ``KiroCrewConfig.load()`` for the value while probing the
    file separately for health is what let malformed input reopen the

    returns a defaults-shaped object, which is indistinguishable from "the
    operator configured nothing" -- and "configured nothing" means
    default-open.  Every shape below was a distinct door into that one room.

    A shape is refused when the operator clearly asked for a restriction we
    cannot honour, and accepted when it is genuinely absent:

    * unreadable / non-object file -> refuse (``ConfigReadError``)
    * a symlink whose target is missing -> refuse; the link is a configuration
      artifact, so config was meant to be here and is merely unavailable. This
      is deliberately NOT the same as the absent-file case below: no file at all
      means none was ever written, which is a fresh install.
    * absent file -> skip; an absent config is genuinely unconfigured
    * ``slack`` present but not an object -> refuse (``load()`` would coerce it
      to ``{}`` and drop the allowlist)
    * ``allowed_enterprise_ids`` absent -> skip, nothing configured here
    * present but not a list -> refuse (``load()`` iterates it, so a bare
      string yields per-character entries)
    * present and non-empty, but NO entry survives validation -> refuse; the
      operator asked for a restriction and none of it is usable, and silently
      collapsing to empty would mean default-open

    Mixed valid/invalid entries keep the valid ones, matching the loader: that
    narrows the allowlist rather than widening it, so it is not a widening
    door and dropping the operator's working ids would be a regression.

    human-authored event (no ``bot_id``) and for an admitted peer bot.

    This is the ONE owner of the admission rule.  Both drop sites — the live
    Socket Mode gate and the transport's ``receive`` — call it, so a rule change
    cannot land on one path while missing the other.  The rule is:

    - **Deny by default.** Admission requires a POSITIVE match against
      ``trusted_ids``, so an empty or unset allow-list drops every bot-authored
      event.
    - **The gateway's own id is never trusted**, even when an operator lists it:
      admitting it would make every reply re-enter as fresh input, a self-reply
      loop.
    - **Unverified self identity fails closed.** When startup ``auth.test`` did
      not run or failed, :func:`validated_self_bot_id` is empty and the
      self-exclusion above cannot be applied, so nobody is trusted — the same
      posture enterprise validation takes for an allow-list it cannot bind to a
      verified workspace.

    ``trusted_ids`` is an ARGUMENT rather than a config read, because the two
    callers deliberately differ on read timing: the event gate reads the live
    config per event, while the transport freezes a constructor snapshot to
    match its ``allowed_users`` pattern.  Which timing is right depends on the
    wiring, not on the rule, so the wiring layer keeps that choice and this
    predicate stays free of config access.
