"""Slack file attachment processing — a thin adapter over the neutral layer.

Slack owns exactly two things on the INBOUND side: mapping its envelope
(``files[]`` dicts with ``url_private_download`` / ``filetype`` / ``mimetype``)
onto :class:`~kiro_crew.messaging.attachments.Attachment`, and supplying an
authenticated download callback. Classification, size caps, magic-byte
validation, redaction, document extraction, SEL audit, and temp cleanup all live
in :mod:`kiro_crew.messaging.attachments` so other channels reuse them instead of
growing a second copy.

Audio is skipped here: Slack transcribes it on a separate upstream path
(``transcribe.py``) before file processing runs. The two visible outcomes of that
path when speech-to-text cannot produce words live here as
:data:`VOICE_MEMO_UNAVAILABLE` / :data:`VOICE_MEMO_FAILED`, beside the mimetype
table, so the transcriber and the ingestion adapter share one vocabulary.

Behaviour:
- returns an ``(attachment_paths, text_blocks)`` contract that ``events.py`` and
  the busy-message queue consume directly
- images and opaque files land in temp files the caller must delete
- opaque files are preserved byte-for-byte with path and metadata, but are not
  automatically parsed or executed
- text and documents are redacted, then truncated, then wrapped in
  ``[File: …]`` / ``[Document: …]`` markers
- size is re-checked AFTER download, so an absent or dishonest Slack ``size``
  (which defaults to 0) cannot bypass the cap
- image bytes must match the declared mimetype's signature
- a per-message attachment cap is enforced

The OUTBOUND half is the mirror image: :mod:`kiro_crew.messaging.outbound_files`
decides which local image references in a reply may be sent and hands back the
validated bytes, and this module supplies the Slack-specific upload: the
budgets Slack's own limits imply, the filename and title it puts on a file, and
the ``files_upload_v2`` call itself. Both halves live here because they answer the
same question in opposite directions, and splitting them across modules is how
the inbound cap and the outbound ceiling start disagreeing about what a picture
is.
