"""Message handler — streams LLM responses to Slack with tool approval UI.

Routes incoming Slack messages through hooks, cron command interception,
and the LLM provider.  Supports interactive tool approval via Block Kit
buttons.

Session privacy modes
---------------------
Temporary (blank-slate): no memory reads, no memory writes, no persistence.
    The session starts with zero context and discards everything on close.
Incognito: memory reads allowed but writes blocked; persists an ephemeral
    conversation log that is discarded on close.

Both modes live in :mod:`kiro_crew.messaging.privacy_mode`, keyed by session key,
so a second channel inherits the same machinery; the names in this module are
thin Slack-facing wrappers over it.  Use :func:`_is_slack_restricted` to check
whether a Slack session should skip memory writes.

    Slack streams by APPENDING and appended text is final (``chat.stopStream``

    same tag quoted mid-message (a fenced example, a line of prose after it)
    is visible content -- and an append-only stream learns which one it has
    only from what follows. So a complete tag stays held while it is still a

    diverges from ``<!--``, or one that spans a line break is released as soon

    ``!``-bang commands are intentionally NOT handled here; they stay in
    ``handle_message`` (owner/allowed gating, mention stripping, modifiers) and
    are being deprecated in favour of slash commands. Slash commands are
    already path-independent (handled upstream of the native-vs-transport gate),
    so they need no porting.

    *handle_sessions* lets the native path opt out of the ``sessions`` branch
    (it keeps its own earlier, position-sensitive ``sessions`` block so that
    ``!temporary``/``!incognito`` modifier rewrites cannot turn a modified
    message into a bare ``sessions`` match). The transport path has no such
    modifier machinery, so it uses the default and handles all four commands.

    post to Slack unconditionally — safe today because trusted bots send
    structured commands (``[TASK:id]``, ``[ACK:id]``) that don't match those
    patterns. Extend if that assumption changes.

    This function accepts individual parameters for backward compatibility.
    New callers can use ``MessageContext`` to group the service parameters.

    *channel_agent* overrides the default agent for this channel (set via
    per-channel config in ``slack.channels``).

    *_compaction_replay* is set only by this function itself, when it re-runs a
    message whose previous attempt was abandoned after a transient compaction
    failure (see the ``STOP_REASON_COMPACTION_FAILED`` branch). Every other
    argument is passed through unchanged, so the replay resolves the same
    session, keeps the same activation and pinning, and can still read the
    attachment files the original text refers to -- their cleanup runs when the
    OUTER call's task ends, after this nested call has returned.

    *links_generation* is the session map's Slack-link generation as of the
    event's RECEIPT (``events._route_message`` captures it beside the client
    that received the event). Every Slack-thread binding this turn writes
    presents it, so a workspace switch that swept the former workspace's
    destinations while this turn was suspended refuses the write instead of

        #   answer-reached = the reader has the answer. The evidence differs by
        #     path, on purpose:
        #       * Streaming: the answer is delivered incrementally as it arrives,
        #         and a refused append is recoverable delivery-debt (a designed
        #         follow-up), not a turn failure -- so a stream that was used is
        #         answer-reached.
        #       * No-stream: the answer is delivered ONLY by the final send, so
        #         answer-reached requires that send to RETURN (not raise). A
        #         truthy placeholder handle is not evidence -- the send itself is.
        #       * No answer text to send (a tool-only turn): nothing to deliver,
        #         answer-reached by definition.
        #
        #   send classification (explicit, not implied by which try block a call
        #     sits in):
        #       answer-carrying -> stream appends; the no-stream fallback send
        #         (``_safe_final_update`` / ``post_message``); and the timing
        #         footer WHEN it carries an [OPTIONS] control, because the trailer
        #         was stripped from the answer and the choices ride only in the
        #         footer.

        #         the redaction overwrite on an already-delivered stream, thinking
        #         posts, the credential notice, and a footer with no options.
        #
        #   verdict -> exactly one per turn, on every exit including exceptions and
        #     cancellation: a failed answer-carrying send books a failure, a

    Awaited immediately BEFORE a host-deny ``reject_tool`` in this module: while
    the permission request is unanswered the turn is provably in flight, which
    is what gets the notice queued rather than dropped (``kiro_crew.deny_notice``).
    The Slack handler has two host denies -- a hook ``deny`` on the message
    path (``DENY_CAUSE_POLICY``, the hook's reason) and the approval prompt
    expiring unanswered (``DENY_CAUSE_APPROVAL_TIMEOUT``). *cause* is REQUIRED
    because the wrong noun sends the model the wrong way. The two genuine USER
    rejections (a Deny click in ``handle_interaction``) and the teardown-only
    ``_reject_orphaned_tool`` must NOT call this: there kiro-cli's wording is
    the truth, and "this was NOT a user action" would be a lie.
    ``test_messaging_deny_notice`` walks the file to keep both halves honest.

    *reason* may echo agent-authored text (a hook's reason quotes the matched
    path), so it is redacted here; the shared helper redacts the title.
    Best-effort by construction: ``steer_refusal_notice`` probes the capability
    and swallows every failure, so a backend without a steer channel behaves
    exactly as before and the caller's reject always runs.

    Cancellation mid-steer (teardown) must still answer the wire: a stranded
    ``session/request_permission`` blocks the subprocess forever and wedges
    every later turn behind it. The reject is scheduled as a strongly referenced
    referenced task and awaited through ``asyncio.shield`` so it is stepped
    while this coroutine unwinds; ``_reject_orphaned_tool`` retrieves its
    exception so teardown stays quiet. *audited* is REQUIRED and says whether
    the caller wrote the decision's SEL row BEFORE this await (the hook deny
    does) or writes it after the wire (the approval-timeout arm, whose
    caller audits both outcomes once the request is answered). The orphan
    reject audits only in the second case: the SEL ledger is append-only,
    and a decision already on it must not gain a second row nothing
