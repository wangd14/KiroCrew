"""The pipeline board panel's contract: one input type, one output type, one provider.

A dashboard needs a data FORMAT, so it gets a type -- not a lookup table saying where
each field could come from. The provider's return type IS the template's input type,
and ``build_pipeline_board`` is the only place the two meet. ``mypy src/kiro_crew/`` is
blocking in CI and ``check_untyped_defs`` is on, so a missing required key is a build
failure rather than a convention.

ONE template, ONE contract type, ONE provider, ONE :data:`CONTRACT_VERSION`. A second
dashboard that needs different data brings its own three. There is deliberately no
general "panel dict" for templates to dig through, because that is the current defect:
:func:`kiro_crew.agent_panel.publish` accepts any object under a size cap, so a
conductor typed owner names into the cell that must say what a person should DO, and
words into the column headed CHECKS. Nothing could refuse it.

So the writable surface is split. :class:`PipelineBoardNumbers` is derived from the
folded work board and a publisher cannot reach it. :class:`PipelineBoardJudgment` holds
the three things no log can produce, each with its own type. The provider merges them,
and the numbers stop being hand-typed.

:data:`UNSAID` is why "nobody can supply this" cannot be forgotten. A key that may be
omitted is omitted silently; a REQUIRED key whose type is ``str | Unsaid`` forces the
provider to write the sentinel out, and mypy rejects both the missing key and a
stray ``None`` from a failed lookup. :func:`panel_payload` is the single exit that
turns the sentinel into the ``null`` the template already renders as "not said" --
and if that step is ever skipped the sentinel shows up as visible text, which is
loud rather than a zero standing in for an unknown.

Unsaid marks a value a writer could supply but did not; a field no writer can ever fill
is removed, not marked. The sentinel exists so a gap is never silently skipped, which
is a different problem from a field that is simply dead: a field with no possible writer
gives every reader a branch that can never be taken, and the parity gate then has to
carry it forever.

#: The host's byte cap, IMPORTED rather than restated.
#:
#: A local copy needs a reason to exist, and the obvious one -- keeping the
#: dashboard package out of its import graph -- does not survive measurement: both consumers
#: of this module (``agent_panel`` and ``dashboard/handlers/agent_panel``) are reached only
#: from inside that package, and importing it adds 4 modules and 4 ms on top of what this
#: module already pulls. So the copy bought nothing and could drift from the number the host
#: actually enforces, which is the one failure a restated cap has: a producer bounding a card
#: against a stale limit builds cards the host drops whole.
#:
#: There is deliberately no constant for the FIELD cap either. ``normalize_card`` spells 24
#: inline and exports nothing, so a name here would be a second copy of a number with no
#: importable source -- and the field count is already asserted the way that matters, by handing
#: the real card to the real ``normalize_card``.

#: Rows one column may print before the rest are counted instead of listed. A first
#: attempt only -- :func:`panel_card_data` lowers it until the whole card fits the byte
#: cap, and says in the row text how many rows it did not print.
_ROWS_PER_COLUMN: Final[int] = 12

#: Bytes each PUBLISHER-WRITTEN field may take. Every other field on the card is derived
#: -- a count, a stamp, a state name -- and is short by construction; these three are free
#: text an agent hands to ``panel_publish``, which caps the whole payload at 64 KB. That is
#: sixteen times this card's entire data budget, so one long sentence in any of them makes
#: the card oversized at EVERY row limit: the row ladder below can only shorten rows, so it
#: retreats to one row per column, still does not fit, and ``normalize_card`` refuses the
#: card whole. A refused card is not a smaller card -- it is no card, reported to the reader
#: as though the feature were switched off. So each of these is clipped first, and the clip

#: ~4200 bytes in one cell that no rung of the ladder can shorten. ``id`` and ``sub`` come from

    THE FLATTENING RULE, in four lines, because ``data`` is flat and a dotted name is not
    even legal -- ``normalize_card``'s ``_FIELD_NAME`` admits
    ``[a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z0-9_-]{0,47}`` only:

    1. A leaf's path becomes its field name with ``_`` for ``.``: ``meta.name`` is
       ``meta_name``, ``omitted`` is ``omitted``.
    2. A list whose length is fixed by a CLOSED vocabulary indexes into one field group
       per element: ``columns`` is :data:`BOARD_COLUMN_NAMES`, so ``columns[0]`` is
       ``column_0_``. ``stats`` is keyed by its own ``k`` instead of by position, so a
       tile's label can be literal text in the page.
    3. A list whose length is UNBOUNDED collapses to one text field on its parent, its
       elements newline-separated: a board holds up to
       :data:`~kiro_crew.work_vocab.WORK_STORED_ITEM_LIMIT` items and the host drops a
       card over 24 fields whole, so ``columns[0].cards`` is ``column_0_rows``.
    4. A leaf the page renders as part of a SENTENCE has no field of its own and reaches
       the card inside the finished sentence: ``meta.age_seconds`` is in ``meta_when``,
       ``progress.total`` is in ``progress_legend`` and in every ``column_N_head``. A
       card has no script to compose a sentence, so composition happens here.

    Every value is words. :data:`UNSAID` becomes :data:`NOT_SAID`, and a published value that
    cannot be read as text becomes :data:`UNREADABLE`. No field carrying a VALUE is ever the
    empty string: the host binds a field it was not given to ``""``, so a blank is what a
    DROPPED field looks like and must not also be what a real value looks like.

    The exception is a field carrying a NOTICE rather than a value -- ``contract_note`` and each
    ``stat_*_note`` -- which is empty exactly when there is nothing to notice. A notice has no
    zero to be confused with, so silence reads correctly there and a permanent phrase would be
    jargon on every healthy board. :func:`_notice` is the one place that decides it.

    Bounded before it returns: the row limit is lowered, and then the per-item action
    lines dropped, until the card fits the host's own ``MAX_DATA_BYTES``. Both retreats are
    stated in the card's own text.
