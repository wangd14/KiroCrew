#: (handlers/messaging.py) evicts the OLDEST entry at this cap, while the

MAX_DURABLE_QUEUE_ENTRIES = 32

#: Byte budget for the whole serialized ``queued_prompts`` value. The metadata
#: line is ONE json line every reader of the session parses, so an unbounded
#: set of long prompts would make it expensive for every reader rather than
#: only for the queue. Entries are admitted front-first until the budget is
#: spent; a prompt is never truncated, because a shortened prompt replayed as
#: the user's own words is worse than one reported as not carried.
MAX_DURABLE_QUEUE_BYTES = 256_000

#: How many raw entries a restore INSPECTS, as distinct from how many it keeps.
#: A retention cap bounds this gateway's own writes; it does not bound a line
#: that was edited or corrupted outside the gateway into carrying a million
#: entries. The apply phase that calls :func:`sanitize_restored_queue` is
#: loop-affine (``_apply_recent_session``), so a scan proportional to the file's
#: content — even a cheap per-item scan — is startup work the event loop cannot
#: shed, and it blocks chat and heartbeat while it runs. Comfortably above the
#: retention cap so an ordinary line with a few dropped entries still restores
#: everything it should; entries past it are reported as not restored, never
#: silently ignored.
MAX_DURABLE_QUEUE_SCAN = 4 * MAX_DURABLE_QUEUE_ENTRIES

#: Queue-entry keys the durable copy carries. Everything else on an entry is
#: process-local plumbing (retry callbacks, synthetic payloads) or is
#: deliberately excluded — see :func:`durable_queue_entries`.
#:
#: ``_directive_user_origin`` and ``_directive_channel_origin`` are NOT here, and
#: their absence is a security property rather than an omission. They record that
#: an entry's words arrived from an authenticated human, and the drain turns that
#: into real authority: ``chat_runner`` reduces the consumed entries' flags into
#: ``producer_is_user_facing``, which admits user-surface and self-arming
#: directives and exempts them from the LINKED containment constraint. The
#: transcript this value is written to is an ordinary readable-writable file in
#: the crew home, not a write-protected one, so anything restored from it is
#: attacker-supplied for the purposes of that decision. Persisting provenance
#: that a later reader cannot distinguish from a hand-edited line would hand
#: human authority to whoever can write the file, so provenance is not carried
#: across a restart at all and restored entries fail closed to non-directive.
#: Marks an entry this process RESTORED rather than accepted. Process-local by
#: construction -- the writer emits only :data:`_DURABLE_QUEUE_KEYS`, so a
#: hand-edited line cannot clear it and cannot forge it either.
#:
#: It exists because dropping provenance is only half a fail-closed rule. A
#: restored entry carries no actor, and "no actor" resolves to ``user`` in the
#: drain -- which is exactly the arm ``model.route`` admits. So the absence has to
#: be readable as "unknown" rather than as "the person's", and this key is what a
#: consumer asks instead of trying to tell the two apart from the actor alone.

    On-disk metadata is a trust boundary (the file can be edited or corrupted
    outside the gateway), so every field is re-checked instead of trusted, and
    anything the durable writer never emits is dropped rather than carried: a
    restored entry must not arrive wearing a ``kind``, a ``payload``, or a
    callback key, because each of those changes what the drain DOES with it.

    Provenance is dropped for the same reason and matters most:
    ``_directive_user_origin``, ``_directive_channel_origin`` and the entry's
    ``meta`` turn actor are never restored, so a restored entry is non-directive
    and actor-less by construction. The drain
    reduces the consumed entries' flags into the authenticated-human authority a
    directive is admitted under, and this line is an ordinary writable file — a
    carried flag would be authority granted to whoever edited it. The writer does
    not emit them either (:data:`_DURABLE_QUEUE_KEYS`); dropping them here is the
    reader's half of the same rule, so a hand-added flag buys nothing.

    ``meta``'s admission-time containment snapshot goes the same way, and the
    asymmetry there is sharper still. The drain's re-check
    (``newly_held_constraints``) treats a constraint the entry recorded as
    already-held as "not a change", so an ABSENT snapshot fails closed against
    every currently-held constraint while a FORGED all-True one reports nothing
    newly held and fails OPEN — a hand-written entry would drain into a linked or
    mirrored slot and republish to an audience its admission never contemplated.
    Stripping the key restores the fail-closed baseline: the entry is re-checked
    against the constraints that hold NOW, the only set this process can vouch
    for. The rest of ``meta`` rides along, because it carries the sender's own
    plumbing (``sendId``, attachments) that decides nothing about audience.

    Capped at :data:`MAX_DURABLE_QUEUE_ENTRIES` entries and
    :data:`MAX_DURABLE_QUEUE_BYTES` of serialized content, the SAME two ceilings
    the persist path admits, costed against the SAME key projection — because the
    writer's bounds only bound what this gateway wrote, and the line it reads back
    can have been edited or corrupted to carry more. Whatever is admitted here is
    retained in the live slot, re-projected to every websocket client and
    re-serialized by every later save, so an unbounded read would let one
    hand-edited line cost the process memory and work forever, not just once at
    parse time. An entry that does not fit is dropped whole: a truncated prompt
    handed back as the user's own words is worse than one reported as not
    carried.

    A third ceiling, :data:`MAX_DURABLE_QUEUE_SCAN`, bounds how much of the raw
    value is INSPECTED at all: the caller that applies a restored session runs on
    the event loop, so walking every entry of an arbitrarily long list — even to
    reject it — is startup work that blocks chat and the heartbeat.
