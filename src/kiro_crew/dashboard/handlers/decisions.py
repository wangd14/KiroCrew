"""Decision-seam REST API -- the operator's switch for Jev egress, and the strip.

``GET  /api/decisions/consent``   the keystone plus the endpoint config names now
``PUT  /api/decisions/consent``   ``{"enabled": bool}`` -> writes it, bound to that endpoint
                                 plus the ``tool_args`` / ``compaction`` /
                                 ``memory_text`` egress scopes,
                                 each preserved when its field is omitted
``POST /api/decisions/feedback``  a person's verdict on one turn -> one appended log row

Consent is bound to a destination: enabling records the provider endpoint the
config names at that moment, and the gate sends only while the two still agree.
The GET returns both so the card can show the owner WHERE consent would send, and
say so when a later config edit moved the destination out from under it.

Above the owner's switch sits the FLEET's: ``capabilities.decisions``
(``decisions/capability.py``). The two answer different questions -- may my messages
be sent, versus may this machine run the seam at all -- so a managed install can
have an owner who consented in good faith to an endpoint the fleet never approved.
A denial refuses an ENABLING PUT with ``403 decisions_capability_denied``, and both
verbs fold it into ``permits`` so no caller reads "a decision would be sent" under a
pin. A DISABLING PUT still succeeds under a denial: the gate already treats the seam
as off, and refusing the write would trap an owner with a stale ``"enabled": true``
keystone they cannot clear.

This handler is the ONLY writer of ``decisions_consent.json``, and that is what
makes "the agent cannot switch on the egress of its own conversation" true: the
keystone leaf is on ``security._CREW_SECRET_LEAVES`` and mounted read-only in
every sandbox, and this handler opens the path directly rather than through the
agent tool gate. The same shape as ``handlers/aws_consent.py``, for the same
class of decision: consent to send the operator's data to a paid external
service.

**Dashboard OWNER only**, on the read as well as the write, and on all four
routes. An app token would otherwise let an agent that can author an app manifest
mint a token and flip the switch it cannot write as a file; a Slack allow-listed
non-owner authenticates with ``app == ""`` and would otherwise consent on the
owner's behalf. Reads are refused too so a non-owner cannot learn whether the
owner's messages are being sent off the machine.

The same gate covers the strip's two routes, for reasons of their own. The
feedback route is a WRITER of the decision log, so an app token that could reach
it could grow that file and pollute the record the operator reads; and the summary
route reports how the operator's own conversations were decided, which is the same
class of fact as whether they are being sent at all.

Blocking work is offloaded: the read and the atomic write touch the filesystem,
and the SEL audit can too when the boot-time warm failed, so none of them runs on
the event loop. Every outcome is audited, the successful read included.

The ``kiro_crew.decisions`` package is imported inside the handlers, not at module
top: this module is imported on the gateway boot path (``handlers/__init__``), and
the seam is an optional subsystem that is off until the owner consents, so its
import is paid on the first request that needs it (``no-new-work-on-gateway-boot-path``).

    no edit on either side, and the set the card draws cannot disagree with the set
    the gate will answer for. The card holds a LABEL per id, the same arrangement
    ``agent_sdk/backend_cards.py`` and the Agent Backend panel use.

    ``status`` is the SERVER's verdict for the same reason ``permits`` is: it is
    derived from the keystone and the governance probe the caller already resolved,
    so the row and the gate cannot report different answers for one point. It is
    never a switch position -- ``off`` is every reason nothing would be sent.

    *permits* is the effective "anything is sent at all" answer, governance denial
    already folded in, so this function performs no probe of its own.

    The SAMPLED SHARE is folded in on the same terms. ``decisions.bucket`` at 0 means
    no session's key falls inside the sample, so every point is asked for nobody and
    does nothing -- and a row reporting ``active`` there would tell a reader the seam
    is working while no turn can reach it. That is the one status word a reader cannot
    check for themselves, so it has to be the effective answer rather than the
    consent-shaped one. ``off`` is already every reason nothing is sent, and a share of
    zero is one of them; the share itself is on screen in the shared block, so a reader
    who sees every row off has the reason one glance away.

    ONE point is not read off the keystone: the judge has two providers, and its row
    has to name the lane that would actually run. ``llm`` reaches the model provider
    the owner's sessions already use, so that row needs neither the endpoint consent
    nor this point's scope -- only a lane that can answer, which means a registered
    runner. ``auto`` resolves to that same lane whenever Jev is not armed, so it is
    ``active`` on either lane being able to answer. An explicitly pinned ``jev`` is
    judged on the keystone AND this point's own scope, fail-closed the way the gate
    reads it: a point with no registered scope has no grant to run that lane on. The
    sampled share binds all three.

async def api_decisions_consent_put(request: web.Request) -> web.Response:
    """PUT /api/decisions/consent -- record ``{"enabled": bool}`` on the keystone.

    Enabling must ECHO the endpoint the owner reviewed (``endpoint`` in the body,
    the ``configured_endpoint`` the GET showed). The config is agent-writable, so
    between the owner's read and their click an agent could point
    ``provider.endpoint`` elsewhere; binding to what the server reads at PUT time
    would then consent to an address the owner never saw. A mismatch is ``409``
    and nothing is written; the card re-reads and shows the new address.

    ``enabled`` may be OMITTED, and then the body must name at least one of the fields
    that may move on their own -- either scope, or the history ceiling. Such a
    write moves only that scope: the switch and the endpoint are read from the keystone
    inside the writer's lock and written back unchanged, so it can neither grant nor
    revoke consent. That is the only safe shape for a scope write, because a body
    carrying ``enabled`` can only carry what its sender last read -- and a view read
    before a revoke would turn egress back on. A body naming neither the switch nor a
    scope is a ``400``.

    A scope-only write against a REVOKED keystone leaves it revoked and stores no scope:
    a scope is only meaningful while the seam is on, which is the same rule that clears
    the scopes on a disabling write.

    A scope-only write against a keystone that IS enabled is additionally REFUSED
    unless consent already stands for the endpoint config names -- ``403`` under a
    governance pin, otherwise ``409`` with the address in force. The revoked case
    above is not one of these: it answers ``200`` and records nothing, because there
    is no address to disagree about. ``permits`` is the predicate, the same one the
    GET reports and the gate enforces, so omitting ``enabled`` can only move a
    scope under a consent that already stands and can never record one for an
    address nobody reviewed.

    ``tool_args`` records whether the owner consented to sending TOOL-CALL
    ARGUMENTS, the category ``tool.risk`` needs. Absent PRESERVES the recorded scope
    and disabling clears it, exactly as the ceiling below behaves, so an ordinary
    switch flip cannot grant or erase it by omission. Absent on a keystone that never
    had it reads as false, which is what keeps a consent given before this scope
    existed meaning only what its owner reviewed.

    ``compaction`` records the same thing for a WHOLE SLOT TRANSCRIPT -- the
    conversation text and every tool-call input in it -- which is what
    ``compaction.keep`` sends and neither of the other two scopes covers. It behaves
    identically: absent preserves, disabling clears, a non-boolean is a ``400``, and
    absent on a keystone that never had it reads as false. It is a field of its own
    rather than a wider reading of ``tool_args`` because the owner reviewed that one
    as the arguments of the one call about to run.

    ``memory_text`` records the same answer for the TEXT OF RECALLED MEMORIES, the
    category ``memory.recall`` needs, on identical terms. Independent fields because
    they are independent decisions: an owner may want risky tool calls flagged without
    the contents of their memory store leaving the machine, and any order of those
    answers has to be recordable.

    ``history_budget_chars`` records the prior-conversation CEILING the owner
    reviewed, and it is here for the same reason ``endpoint`` is: the value in force
    lives in agent-writable ``config.json``, so a budget recorded only there could be
    raised by the agent whose conversation would then be sent. The gate takes the
    smaller of the two.

    It is optional, and an omitted field PRESERVES the recorded ceiling rather than
    clearing it. The consent card sends ``enabled`` and ``endpoint`` only, so a
    default of 0 would make an ordinary switch flip erase a ceiling recorded through
    this same route. The two facts stay independent: the switch says whether the seam
    may send, the ceiling says how much prior conversation it may carry, and each
    moves only when its own field is present. Disabling still clears the ceiling,
    because a later enable must not inherit a budget nobody re-reviewed.

    Outcomes: ``200`` with the new state; ``400`` for a body that is not a JSON
    object, or whose ``enabled`` is present and not a boolean (plus a string
    ``endpoint`` when enabling, and a non-negative whole ``history_budget_chars``
    when present); ``403`` for a non-owner, and for an ENABLING or SCOPE-ONLY write
    the ceiling withdrew (``decisions_capability_denied``); ``409`` when the echoed
    endpoint is not the one config names now, and for a scope-only write against a
    keystone ENABLED for a different address than config names. A scope-only write
    against a REVOKED keystone is not a ``409``: it answers ``200`` and records no
    scope, because a scope is only meaningful while the seam is on and there is no
    address to disagree about; ``500`` for a corrupt keystone, which is left
    byte-identical rather than clobbered (the ``StateCorruptError`` precedent in
    ``handlers/computer_use.py``).

    (:mod:`kiro_crew.decisions.log`, ``no-blocking-call-on-event-loop``).

    Outcomes: ``200 {"ok": true}``; ``400`` for a body that is not a JSON object
    with a non-empty ``turn_id``, a PRESENT ``verdict`` key in the allowed set (or
    ``null``) and a side in the allowed set; ``403`` for a non-owner; ``503
    decisions_feedback_not_recorded`` when the append did not land. An omitted
    ``verdict`` is a ``400`` and not a retract: ``null`` is the retract, so a body
    that dropped the field would otherwise record one.

    That last one is the difference between this caller and every other writer of
    the decision log. Elsewhere a dropped row is an observation nobody promised,
    so ``log.append`` swallows it. Here the row IS the person's answer, and the
    day-file has a size ceiling that the turn's own rows share: on a busy sampled
    day the ceiling is reached by round traffic, and a ``200`` would tell the
    owner their verdict was recorded while nothing was written. So the append's
    verdict is read and reported, and the SEL row says ``denied`` for it -- a
    refusal that audits as success is the same lie one layer down.

# ── Local models ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#
# ``GET /api/decisions/provider`` lists the local presets and which one the config
# names; ``PUT`` switches the provider to a preset. The PUT is the ONE dashboard
# writer of ``decisions.provider.*``: the generic config PATCH excludes that section
# so a dashboard caller cannot choose where decision state is sent, and this route
# keeps that true by taking a preset id and a port, never a URL. The endpoint it
# writes is either the shipped Jev default or ``http://127.0.0.1:<port>/v1/systemone``,
# built here. Owner-only on both verbs, for the reasons the module docstring gives.
#
# Consent is bound to the endpoint, so a switch leaves an existing consent pointing
# at the old address. Switching TO a local preset carries a standing consent across
# to the new address, because the owner is choosing it in this request and nothing
# it sends leaves the machine. Switching back to hosted Jev never does: that is the
# direction that starts egress, and it waits for the consent switch like any other
# change of address.
