"""Telemetry handlers — read the local OTEL metric shards for the dashboard.

An OpenTelemetry recorder's default sink is per-process JSONL
under ``~/.kiro/crew/metrics/metrics-YYYY-MM-DD-<pid>.jsonl`` (see
``kiro_crew.metrics.local_exporter``). Each line is one export cycle serialized
via ``MetricsData.to_json()`` — resource_metrics -> scope_metrics -> metrics ->
data.data_points, where a histogram data point carries ``bucket_counts`` +
``explicit_bounds`` + ``count``/``sum``/``min``/``max`` and a sum/counter data
point carries ``value``.

This module scans those shards (windowed + cached, mirroring the token-usage
handler in ``usage.py``), aggregates the session-startup histogram into
p50/p90 split by cold/warm (the ``spawned`` attribute) + an outcome breakdown,
and generically surfaces every other ``kirocrew.*`` metric so newly-added emit
call-sites (warm-pool acquire, MCP/skill lazy-load) show up without a code
change here.

Cross-process note: the startup metric is emitted by the ACP/gateway processes,
NOT the dashboard process, so an in-memory reservoir in this process could never
observe it — reading the durable shards is the only correct cross-process path.

Percentiles are interpolated from the histogram buckets (the DELTA-temporality
exporter + the explicit-bucket View in ``provider.py`` make this meaningful and
day-additive). mean/min/max are exact from the data point.

# These are reduced through the CUMULATIVE reducer instead of the gauge one.

#
#   * The gauge reducer reports the newest sample, which for a lifetime total is

#   * They WERE observable counters, so shards written before that changed carry

#     structure is what keeps one continuous series across the switch instead of
#     splitting the window into a counter row and a gauge row.

# stop reason to give (a bare TurnUsage at a helper call site), so counting it

    Data points are grouped by their EXACT ``explicit_bounds``, and every

    14-day scan window straddling a boundary change holds two incompatible
    generations of the same metric.

    Merging them positionally fabricates values. Two generations with the same
    bucket-count length would pass a naive length check while meaning entirely
    different things — a sample from one generation sitting in its ``+Inf``
    bucket would be added to the other's ``+Inf`` bucket, and a 5s sample could be
    counted
    into a 5-minute bucket, letting ``_pct_from_buckets`` report a p90 that no
    turn ever took. Grouping also keeps ``count``/``sum``/``min``/``max``
    consistent with the percentiles: accumulating those across generations while
    only one generation's buckets survive would describe a mean over one
    population and percentiles over another.

    The reported group is the one holding the **newest** data point, not the
    largest. Majority selection would let a stale generation keep winning for as
    long as it out-counted the new one: right after a boundary change the window
    still holds up to ``_WINDOW_DAYS`` of old samples against a handful of new
    ones, so the OLD bounds would be reported — for the turn metric that means
    serving the very ceiling-pinned percentiles this grouping exists to eliminate,
    while omitting the new samples entirely. Recency makes a boundary change take
    effect on the first sample after it. The reported population
    is then small but truthful, and ``count`` says so; fuller-but-wrong is the
    failure mode being fixed.

    ``other_generations`` exposes how many groups were seen beyond the reported

    Two record shapes land here and they describe the same thing: a CUMULATIVE
    sum (what the process CPU/GC instruments wrote while they were observable
    counters) and a lifetime-total GAUGE (what they write now). Either way the
    stream re-emits a process-lifetime snapshot every export cycle. Two
    ordering/window traps shape this reducer:

    * Samples were buffered during the scan and are sorted by timestamp here,
      because shard iteration order is not chronological — a per-PID stream
      spans one shard per day plus rotations, and running reset detection in
      file order would misread an older sample seen after a newer one as a
      process restart, banking the newer segment and inflating the total.
    * Each stream's total is **window-relative**: its first in-window sample is
      the baseline, so a process older than the shard window reports only the
      activity that happened inside the window, never its lifetime total. A
      process that started in-window loses at most the activity before its
      first export cycle — under-reporting, never over-reporting.

    Streams are keyed by (shard PID, process identity, attrs). The identity is
    the resource-level start-time token the exporter stamps
    (``RESOURCE_ATTR_PROCESS_START_TIME``), so a PID reused by a new process
    lands in a NEW stream deterministically — each process contributes its own
    window-relative delta even when the reuser's first snapshot already exceeds
    the predecessor's maximum, the one shape the value heuristic below cannot
    see. An unchanged identity across provider rebuilds (telemetry off/on)
    stitches the rebuild segments into one stream. Within an identity-keyed
    stream a value below the running maximum is shard garbage, never a reset:
    one identity is one OS process, whose lifetime totals are monotonic,
    and banking a garbage drop would double-count the recovery.

    The value-below-segment-max RESET heuristic applies ONLY to identity-less
    streams (legacy shards written before the field existed, or platforms
    whose start-time read is unavailable): a drop marks a process boundary,
    banking the finished segment; re-emitted snapshots >= the max are no-ops,
    so provider rebuilds stay idempotent. Either way, stream total = banked
    segments + live segment - baseline (never negative: the baseline is a

    App isolation is ROW-level (App Kit §5.2, deny-by-default): an app caller
