    The per-turn drill-down under :func:`slot_spend`'s aggregate: each row is
    one turn's shard record — model, token counts, credits, duration, and the
    context meter — for the slot named. Built for the app-facing usage API: an
    app that runs agent sessions (via app-owned slots) can account for what its
    own turns cost without reaching into the shard files, whose location and
    row shape are this module's private contract.

    Same walk and the same reasons as :func:`context_trace`: per-session
    per-turn detail stays OUT of the OTEL pipeline because slot keys are
    unbounded-cardinality labels. Malformed lines and foreign slots are
    skipped, not errors — a shard is an append-only log written by a live
    gateway, and a torn tail line is expected during a write.

    ``app`` is the ownership filter for app callers: only rows STAMPED with
    that app at write time are returned. Ownership recorded on the row is what
    survives the slot — a live-slot check both leaks on slot-name reuse (a
    recreated slot vouches for the previous owner's rows) and denies an app
    its own completed sessions. Rows written before the stamp existed carry no
    ``app`` and are invisible to app callers: deny-by-default for ownership
    that was never recorded. ``None`` (the dashboard) reads everything.

    The window is enforced per ROW, not only per shard file: the oldest shard
    in the window covers a whole day, so without a row-level cutoff a request
    for N days returns rows up to a day older than asked — wrong in the one

    """Per-turn injection breakdown for one slot, oldest turn first.

    Served from the slot's ``usage`` PROJECTION -- one memoised fold read -- and no
    longer by scanning the token shards. The scan it replaces opened every shard in
    the window, JSON-parsed every row in each, and threw away all but this slot's:
    work proportional to the whole installation's turn volume to answer a question
    about one session. The crew log already records the same composition
    (``context/composed``, which the ``usage`` fold folds into ``context.turns``),
    so the projection is where the answer lives.

    Billing stays out of the payload: :func:`slot_turn_usage` is the per-turn reader
    for ``credits`` / ``duration_ms``, and this trace answers only "what was
    injected".

    Kept out of the OTEL pipeline for the same reason as :func:`context_occupancy`:
    this is per-session, per-turn detail, and slot keys are unbounded-cardinality
    labels that must not become metric labels. The bounded half (block label ->
    size, aggregated) is what belongs on a metric; this is the drill-down.

    ONE BOUND on the payload: *days*. Turns older than the window are excluded, so
    ``window_days`` keeps meaning what it meant and a caller asking for 14 days is
    still answered about 14 days. The fold's own truncation needs no second field,
    because every row carries its own ``ordinal`` -- a reader shown a truncated list
    reads the first row's true position and knows exactly how much precedes it, which
    a whole-session drop count applied to an array index could never tell it.

    ``peak_context_used`` and ``context_window`` are the PROVIDER's own occupancy
    reading and the window it was taken against, and they are ONE pair from ONE turn
    -- the fullest turn INSIDE the day window. Both halves matter. The pair, because
    the Session Breakdown tree divides one by the other, and a reading over a window
    from somewhere else describes no turn that ran (a model switch moves the window).
    Inside the window, because the caller asked about a span of days: on a long
    session the fullest turn is frequently older than every row in that span. Neither
    is derived from the turn's token counts, which are billing summed over every model
    call and on a tool-using turn exceed the window they would be divided by.

    HISTORY BEFORE THIS RELEASE. The crew log is the only source now, so a session
    whose ``context/composed`` entries predate this fold reads with an unstated
    ``phase`` (its chart does not split the session-start turn out) and no occupancy
    until its first turn closes under this build; a session recorded with the crew log
    switched off reads empty. No read-through to the token shards is offered, and that
    is deliberate rather than deferred: this release stops writing ``ctx_blocks`` to
    the row, and the scan it would perform was bounded to ``days``, so such a fallback
    could serve data for at most that many days after release and would read nothing
    for the rest of its life. A read path with a provable expiry date is worse than
    none. Both cases self-heal as new turns are recorded.

    Block sizes are in characters and occupancy is in tokens.

    acp provider populates -- input/output/cache/cost come back hard zero -- so
    it is the unit here, with ``context_used`` as the second real signal.

    Three deliberate shapes:

    * **Every** model is reported, never a top-N slice. A truncated list hides a
      model switch, which on real data moved the bill far more than usage volume
      did, and a single-user store is small enough to render complete.
    * ``channel`` is derived from the session key, NOT read from the row's
      ``surface`` field. Historical rows can carry a wrong but non-empty value
      such as ``dashboard`` for a Telegram turn, and the token-row schema has no
      version or writer marker that distinguishes them from trustworthy rows.
      The key therefore remains authoritative until the store gains such a
      boundary; a surface-first fallback would silently misattribute history.
    * Context bands are absolute token counts rather than occupancy ratios:
      spend tracks how many tokens get re-sent, and window sizes differ per
      model, so a ratio would average incomparable populations.

    carries a ``type: ignore``). A default Kiro turn therefore hides its resolved
    state two levels down, at ``provider.client._handle``, so probing a fixed
    depth misses it.

    Depth-first along the holder attributes, with an identity-based visited set
    so a wrapper that points back at itself (or two wrappers that share a
    runtime) terminates. Depth-first, not breadth-first, because the model state
    sits at the BOTTOM of the holder chain while every wrapper layer above it —
    a fallback wrapper, session sharing, a subagent companion, a channel-linked
    session — carries siblings that hold nothing. A breadth-first walk with a
    node budget spends that budget on the siblings and, a few layers down,
    stops short of the ``_model`` node; ``_resolve_model`` then persists a blank
    and the credits land in the read-time ``unknown`` bucket. Following the
    chain downward first reaches the handle regardless of how many layers are
    stacked on top; :data:`_WRAPPER_CHAIN_MAX_NODES` is a runaway guard for
    attribute-synthesizing sources, not a depth limit.

    ``_runtime`` is traversed **last** deliberately. It is the only holder of
    ``_agent`` for the session-provider shape (``runtime.py:273``), but it also
    carries the process-level ``--model`` argument (``runtime.py:280``); visiting
    it after the whole ``_handle`` subtree keeps session-level model state ahead
    of process-level state when :func:`read_effective_model` falls through to
    ``_model``.

    ``kirocrew.turn.duration`` plus the turn's usage family
    (``kirocrew.turn.tokens`` and whichever of ``kirocrew.turn.credits`` /
    ``kirocrew.turn.cost_usd`` the backend billed in). Split out so the emit is
    one statement in the persist path and can be asserted directly by a test
    without writing a row.

    Reads every value off the RECORD rather than recomputing from
    ``event``/``elapsed_ms``: the builder already applies the
    provider-reported-wins-else-wall-clock rule for the duration and already
    coerces the usage fields, so duplicating either here is how the row store and
    the metrics would come to disagree about one turn. ``model`` and ``provider``
    come from the same place for the same reason — the record's ``model`` is the
    RESOLVED one (``_resolve_model``), so the attribute names the model that ran
    rather than the alias the caller asked for.

    An ABSENT ``stop_reason`` attribute and a ``None``/empty one mean different
    things and must not collapse. A bare ``TurnUsage`` has no such attribute and
    cannot say how its turn ended (``unclassified``); an ``LLMEvent`` whose
    ``stop_reason`` is ``None`` is reporting a CLEAN turn, which is what the acp
    path leaves on a normal completion. The distinction lives here rather than in
    ``turn_outcome`` because only this layer can see whether the attribute exists
    at all — and it must not be resolved by a default: labelling the bare-usage
    case ``ok`` claims successes nobody observed, while labelling it ``unknown``
    puts it in ``telemetry._TERMINAL_FAULT_OUTCOMES`` and invents a fault for
    every clean background turn.
