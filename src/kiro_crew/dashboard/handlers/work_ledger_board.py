"""The Crew page's read of a conductor's work ledger (RFC Phase 4, the surfaces).

`handlers/work_ledger.py` serves the CONDUCTOR: it is MCP-only, it resolves which
ledger to read from the caller's own `X-Session-Key`, and its item rows carry
`worker_session_key`. None of those three suit a browser. A page has a cookie
rather than a session key, so it cannot address a ledger at all through that
route, and Phase 4 forbids `worker_session_key` in any Crew page payload.

So this module adds a second read over the SAME store, for the other caller:

* **Masked.** A row is `WorkItem.to_dict()` minus `worker_session_key`, plus the
  derived flags the conductor's read already adds and the joined `alive` state.
  The mask is applied by naming the field to drop, not by listing the fields to
  keep, so a field added to the item later appears on the page instead of
  silently going missing — and the one field that must never appear is the one
  spelled out.
* **Cookie-authenticated.** Deliberately NOT in
  ``server._STRICT_INTERNAL_API_PATHS``: that list is what forces the
  internal-secret path, and a browser caller would fail it. The principal here is
  the dashboard owner, who already reads every session on this gateway, so the
  ledger to show comes from the query string. That is not the thing
  ``handlers/work_ledger.py``'s contract forbids: what it refuses is one AGENT
  session naming another's ledger, which is a privilege claim. A human operator
  naming their own conductor is not.
* **Liveness joined here.** ``alive`` is derived server-side from the worker's
  session key and the key itself is then dropped, which is the only way to answer
  "is this worker running" on a page that may not receive the key.

The conductor's route is not touched, so nothing reading it today can break.

#: ``dashboard/session_control.py`` exposes ``create_session``, ``stop_target``,

#: re-owns a session, and ``work_ledger.CONDUCTOR_ACTIONS`` is
#: ``{create, bind, decide, verdict, close, goal}`` with no action that transfers an
#: item to another conductor. So a take-over has neither a session-level nor a
