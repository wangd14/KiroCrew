    """Redact ``val``, dropping control characters but keeping the content around them.

    Invisible characters split a token, and both redactors decide by matching a pattern,
    so a token split by one matches nothing and the field egresses carrying it. They do
    not all deserve the same treatment on the way out, though, and that is the whole of
    this function's shape.

    A CONTROL character other than tab, newline and carriage return is terminal-escape
    material rather than text a user wrote, so it always leaves: it drives a terminal that
    renders the field verbatim, and no consumer is worse off without it. Those three are
    content and stay, which is why a token split by one of them is still split afterwards.
    Removing a control character can JOIN a token back together, which is why the redactors
    run again afterwards rather than trusting the first verdict.

    A FORMAT character is usually content. A soft hyphen inside a word, a joiner holding an
    emoji together, a mark ordering a Latin digit before Arabic -- deleting those rewrites
    what the user stored, on a path that runs for every row of every listing, and the
    caller that compares this function's output with its input to decide whether a
    document is editable then refuses every write to it. So a copy with the format
    characters removed is scanned as EVIDENCE, and handed back only when it reveals a
    credential the output still hides: that field holds a credential, so its exact bytes
    are the thing that must not egress, and its own format characters go with them.

    Scanning the text as stored first is not redundant with scanning that copy. Removing
    an invisible character can destroy a boundary a pattern requires, so a token the
    stored text matches can stop matching once the copy is joined up.

    A JSON document is a transport encoding, and encoding hides the very characters the
    scan looks for: a control character inside the payload is written as the six printable
    characters ``\\u0001``, so the control pattern finds nothing to remove and the token it
    splits stays split for both redactor passes. The field then egresses carrying the
    credential, and whatever decodes the document -- a browser calling ``JSON.parse`` --
    gets the control character back, where it renders as nothing and the credential reads
    as whole. A memory row carries the same value twice, as text and as JSON, so scanning
    only the text redacts one copy of a credential and ships the other.

    Scrubbing therefore descends into the decoded value. The field is replaced only when
    that changed something, so a document holding nothing sensitive is passed through
    byte for byte rather than re-serialised into a different spelling of itself.

    Only a document decoding to a string, list or dict is considered: a bare JSON number
    or boolean carries no text to scan, and a plain prose field does not parse at all.

    Two ways of failing are kept apart, because only one of them leaves a payload behind.
    The dividing line is the PARSER's own verdict on the STORED bytes, not on the text in
    hand: the scan runs on scrubbed text, and a credential-assignment pattern spans a name,
    its colon and its value, so splicing one out can leave text that fails to parse even
    though the stored document parses fine. Text the parser rejects AND that was never a
    document
    holds no JSON payload at all, so the text scrub already covered everything there was to
    cover and the field passes through. Every other failure means a payload existed and
    decoding could not finish -- nested past the cap, nested deeply enough to exhaust the
    parser's own recursion, repeating an object name so decoding discards a member, holding
    names that collide once scrubbed, tripping a limit of this interpreter that a consumer's
    parser does not share such as the cap on converting a very long integer, or broken by
    the scrub's own replacement. Such a document has a payload this chain cannot certify,

    Lives here (not in ``memory.py``) so handlers that ``memory.py`` itself

    cycle.

    SHAPE-PRESERVING for a container, and the overloads above say so rather than
    flattening every result to ``object``: a caller that hands this a dict and then
    bounds or indexes the result would otherwise need a cast, which asserts the shape
    instead of reading it off the function. A dict comes back a dict, a list a list
    and a string a string.

    NOT shape-preserving for bytes, which is why one type variable would be the wrong
    tool here: binary is dropped to ``None`` rather than redacted, since it is not
    text this chain can scan and returning it unread would put an unscanned blob on an
    egress path. That case falls to the ``object`` overload.

    The redactors run TWICE, once on the text as stored and once after invisible
    characters are removed, because each pass catches what the other cannot.

    Both redactors decide by matching a pattern. An invisible character embedded
    mid-token splits the token so no pattern matches it, and the field would leave on
    an egress path carrying credential material any consumer that drops those
    characters can reassemble. Removing them first rejoins the token, which is what the
    second pass sees.

    The first pass is not redundant, because removing a character can also DESTROY a
    match. A pattern guarded by a negative lookbehind for a non-word character is
    satisfied by the invisible character itself, so joining a word character onto the
    token defeats it -- a credential the text as stored would have given up survives
    normalisation. Scanning the original first keeps that verdict.

    Normalising between the two passes rather than after both is what makes the order
    safe. Normalising after the last pass would reassemble the very token that pass had
    just failed to match, and the field would egress the whole secret.

    Tab, newline and carriage return are content and survive, so a token split by one of
    those three stays split; see

    Returns ``(body, None)`` on success, or ``(None, error_response)`` when the

    endpoints routed through it: ``await request.json()`` happily returns a
    list, string, or number for a body that is valid JSON but not an object, and
    a handler that then calls ``.get()`` on the result turns a client mistake
    into a 500.

    A request that HAS a body must also DECLARE a JSON content type, or it is
    refused 415 ``unsupported_media_type`` before the body is read -- see
    :func:`_json_content_type_error`. Parsing a ``text/plain`` or
    content-type-less body as JSON is what lets a cross-origin page deliver a
    JSON command to a local endpoint with no CORS preflight; requiring the
    header puts the preflight back. In-tree callers are unaffected: every client
    that sends a body already sets ``application/json`` (the frontend
    ``post``/``put``/``patch``/``del`` helpers, ``mcp_core``, ``cron_script``,
    ``cli_*``, ``pod.runtime``, ``remote_relay``), and the bodiless requests
    (``app_lifecycle_client``, ``cron_trigger``) are not checked.

    ONE caller opts OUT, and must: ``POST /api/messaging/teams``, where
    Microsoft's Bot Framework Connector posts activities, passes
    ``require_json_content_type=False``. Two reasons, and the second is the
    load-bearing one:

    * Refusing a media type there is a change to an EXTERNAL contract. The route
      is the single entry in ``token_auth.CSRF_EXEMPT_EXACT_METHODS``, so the
      Origin barrier does not stand in front of it, and a media-type refusal
      would be the one refusal that could silently stop an external channel.
    * The gate cannot be enforced there ANYWAY, and enforcing it costs the byte
      cap. ``handlers/messaging.py`` forwards this helper's error only when it is
      a 413, because a verdict derived from body CONTENT must not precede the JWT
      check. A 415 is therefore dropped, the parsed body is never stashed, and
      ``teams/client.py``'s fallback re-parses with a bare ``request.json()`` --
      on a stream this helper returned from WITHOUT reading, so the re-parse is
      bounded only by the app-wide ``client_max_size`` instead of
      ``TEAMS_MAX_ACTIVITY_BYTES`` (64 KiB). Opting out keeps the capped read,
      and with it the stash, so the body is parsed exactly once and never past
      the cap.

    Which generalizes to the rule any future caller must satisfy: because the
    415 and the declared-oversize 413 return BEFORE a single byte is read, a
    caller that does not return every error this helper hands back must pass
    ``require_json_content_type=False``, or it inherits an unread stream that
    nothing bounds. Every other caller in the tree returns the error
    unconditionally (``chat_pins`` rewrites a 400's code and then returns it),
    so the Teams route is the only opt-out.

    Which also means: this gate is a SECOND barrier, not the first one. Every
    other unsafe-method ``/api/`` route is already refused cross-origin by
    ``csrf_middleware``, so on those routes the 415 removes no primitive that
    was reachable -- it holds if a route is ever added to the CSRF-exempt list,
    or the Origin barrier is ever mis-scoped, without waiting for that mistake
    to be exploitable. Extending the refusal to the Teams route is a separate
    decision about an external contract, not part of this one.

    The other self-authenticating webhook, ``POST /api/hooks/agent``, reads
    through ``handlers/hooks.py::_json_object`` and is untouched by this.

    NOT yet the dashboard's only such guard. Four siblings survive and diverge:
    ``handlers_channel._json_object`` (same ``invalid_json``/``body_not_object``
    codes, but raises ``HTTPBadRequest`` instead of returning the response),
    ``handlers/hooks.py::_json_object`` (``default_empty=True`` collapses a
    MALFORMED body to defaults), ``handlers/session_storage.py::_json_body``
    (deliberately different: an empty body is legitimate there, and it
    documents why), and ``handlers/artifacts.py::_read_json_body`` (raises
    ``ArtifactValidationError``, carries its own cap). Folding or narrowing each
    is still outstanding -- claiming one owner before that is done would be a
    claim the tree does not support.

    The cap is enforced BEFORE decoding: a Content-Length precheck rejects an
    oversized declared body, and the stream is then read incrementally so a
    chunked body (which carries no Content-Length) cannot buffer past
    ``max_bytes + one chunk`` on the event-loop thread. That bound is the point
    of the helper for the strict-internal notification routes.

    ``max_bytes=None`` reads the body whole with no pre-decode ceiling, for the
    endpoints that have no principled byte limit today (a knowledge bundle
    import has no defensible maximum size). It is deliberately explicit rather
    than the default: an endpoint opting out of the cap should say so at the
    call site, and giving one of those endpoints a real ceiling later is then a
    one-argument change here instead of a re-plumb.

    Which one a converting caller wants is a real choice, not a default to
    inherit: take the cap when the body is a fixed set of control fields (an
    identifier, a flag, a number), and ``None`` only when the body legitimately
    carries user content of unbounded size (file contents, an export, a fetched
    document). Note that switching a site TO the cap also moves it off
    ``request.json()`` onto the streaming read, so that handler's unit tests
    must feed ``content``/``content_length`` rather than mocking ``json``.

    *allow_absent* treats a request with no readable body as an empty object,
    for endpoints whose fields all have defaults. A body that is *present but
    malformed* is still a 400 -- "the client sent nothing" and "the client sent
    garbage" are different facts, and only the first one can be defaulted.

    Decoding matches ``request.json()`` on both paths -- ``decode(charset or
    utf-8)`` then ``loads`` -- so the two differ only in whether the read is
    bounded, and the declared ``charset=`` is honoured either way. The uncapped
    path calls ``request.json()`` itself rather than reimplementing it, which is
    what makes converting a ``try: await request.json()`` site a drop-in: no
    handler and no test harness sees a different read.

    The catch is narrowed to the three client-input failures -- ``ValueError``
    (which covers ``json.JSONDecodeError`` and ``UnicodeDecodeError``),
    ``LookupError`` (an unknown ``charset=`` codec), and ``RecursionError`` (a
    deeply nested document blowing the parser's stack). Transport failures (a
    disconnect mid-body, a read timeout) deliberately propagate: they are not a
    client JSON mistake and keep their 500 status class.

#: ``chat_folders._agent_binding_refusal``) and
#: renames/reparents its OWN (POST + PATCH on the
#: tree) -- the PATCH handler refuses a member's ``project_dir`` set or clear
#: and a reparent that would change what the moved folder's sessions inherit
#: (binding or steering) -- but does NOT delete folders (delete is refused for
#: every agent principal); it READS the shared tag vocabulary (GET) but does NOT
#: coin/rename/delete tags (``chat_tags.api_chat_tag_delete`` has no
#: vocabulary fence at all, so admitting DELETE would let a member remove a
#: shared tag); it files/tags only its own or created sessions. The per-handler
#: ownership fence (``owner_app``/``folder_principal`` for the tree,
#: ``member_owns_slot`` for filing/tagging, ``_refuse_vocabulary_write`` for tag
#: creation/rename) is still the authoritative gate; this set just refuses to

    credential must never out-scope the session authorizing it.

    Returns ``(carried_claims, ttl_ceiling_seconds)``. ``ttl_ceiling`` is ``0``
    when the caller has no lifetime left to lend, which the handler refuses
    rather than minting against. Claims are carried, never re-derived: ``boot``
    copied verbatim (same rule as the link→session exchange in ``token_auth``),
    ``no_refresh`` copied so the recipient session never grows a refresh chain,
    and the remaining ``session_exp`` becomes the TTL ceiling so a short-lived
    caller cannot mint a longer-lived credential. ``require_peer`` and its
    signed ``peer_key`` move as one inseparable device bound. Fail-closed on an
    unreadable payload: a caller whose bounds cannot be established gets a
    bounded (no-refresh, default-TTL-capped) link rather than an unbounded one.

    **Read the credential the middleware VALIDATED, not a re-extracted one.**
    Only that credential has a verified signature; the other one was never
    checked. ``token_auth`` publishes it as ``request["auth_token"]`` for
    exactly this reason: its own extraction prefers ``?token=`` but falls back
    to the session cookie when the query token is invalid, so re-deriving with
    a fixed query-then-cookie order could pick the credential that was NOT
    validated — letting a request that authenticated with a bounded cookie have
    its bounds read from an unverified, attacker-settable query token, dropping
    ``no_refresh`` and raising the TTL ceiling to the full maximum, which is
    precisely the ceiling-escape this function exists to prevent. When no
    credential was published (a surface that authenticated by another means),
    the mint is bounded fail-closed the same way an unreadable payload is.

    **A non-positive remaining lifetime is never rounded up.** Clamping it to a
    floor of one second would let a caller whose own session has just run out
    mint a link that outlives it, and the exchange the recipient performs starts
    a fresh window — so repeating the mint would walk the expiry forward
    indefinitely from a session that should already be dead. Report ``0`` and

    * A forged or stale key from a context that never had a real session

    Three distinct outcomes, and the distinction IS the security property:

    * ``"persistent"`` / ``"incognito"`` / ``"temporary"`` — read from the
      metadata line. A metadata line that parses but carries no ``memory_mode``
      is reported as ``"persistent"``: the field postdates the feature, so a
      valid header without it is genuinely a legacy persistent session.
    * ``None`` — **unknown**. No file, or no parseable metadata object as the
      first line. Callers gating memory writes MUST deny on ``None`` rather
      than treat it as persistent. Denying is safe: ``ConversationLog.append``
      writes the metadata line when it creates the file, before any message is
      appended, so a session file whose first line is not metadata was not
      produced by a normal session and is no evidence that writes are allowed.

    This is the recovery path for a session whose in-memory state is gone but
    whose transcript is still on disk. Both in-memory signals a restricted
    session normally carries are dropped when a tab is archived
    (``api_chat_slot_close`` removes the slot from ``state._slots`` *and*
    discards its key from ``state._restricted_keys``), while the transcript —
    including its ``memory_mode`` marker — persists. Without reading that
    marker back, an archived incognito session whose MCP subprocess is still
    alive presents as an ordinary established session and its memory writes
    are allowed.

    Only the FIRST line is consulted, and only ``_METADATA_HEAD_MAX_BYTES`` of
    it: a later ``_type: metadata`` object is message content, not the header,
    and must not be able to redefine the mode. Byte-bounding keeps an enormous
    or adversarial first line from pinning memory.

    Blocking file I/O — call from a worker thread, never on the event loop
    (AUTOSDE ``no-blocking-call-on-event-loop``); prefer

    Same two answers as :func:`resolve_requested_memory_store` — ``""`` for the
    global store, a name for a silo — and the same 404 ``unknown_memory_store``
    for a name nobody declared.

    A POST names its store in the BODY rather than the query string, because that
    is where the rest of its arguments are, so the body is consulted first and
    the query resolver handles the absent case. The body key is
    :data:`MEMORY_STORE_PARAM` deliberately: one spelling for both transports is
    what keeps a route from starting to answer for a store under a second name
    the seam never sees.

    Only the DECLARED-name half of the seam is re-expressed here, never the gate:
    every caller of this function has already taken
    :func:`require_owner_dashboard_request` unconditionally, which is strictly
    stronger than the presence gate the query resolver applies.

    A value that is present but not a string REFUSES rather than falling through
    to the caller's binding, and gets the same 404 an undeclared name gets. Both
    halves matter: a mutation whose store field was mistyped must not silently
    land on the default store, and distinguishing malformed from unknown would
    report whether a given name is declared.
