class _LockedSectionWrite:
    """One channel's ``config.json`` write, through ``update_config_locked``.

    Every per-channel settings saver in this module merges a staged dict into
    its own top-level section and, when the paired ``.env`` write then fails,
    undoes that merge. This is that step, written once, because each saver is a
    hand-copied credential-write skeleton and the copy is how an unlocked write
    arrives (see ``TestTheAtomicJsonWriteConfigFamilyIsRatcheted``).

    ``apply`` merges ``changes`` into -- and drops ``drop_keys`` from -- the named
    section of the config as re-read INSIDE the sidecar lock, so a concurrent
    edit to an unrelated key is preserved instead of being replaced by the
    caller's older snapshot. The advisory lock on ``<path>.lock`` is what keeps
    another PROCESS (``kirocrew config set``) from landing between the read and
    the write; the in-process ``_get_config_lock()`` the caller holds only
    serializes writers inside this one.

    ``restore`` undoes only the keys this write touched, and only where the
    stored value is still the one it wrote. Rewriting the file from a whole-file
    snapshot would revert whatever a concurrent writer landed; restoring the
    whole section would still discard a concurrent ``kirocrew config set
    <channel>.*`` that arrived between our write and the rollback. A key whose
    stored value differs from what we wrote has been changed by someone else
    since, and reverting it would destroy their edit to undo ours.

    ``seed_from`` names a legacy section (WeCom's ``wechat``) whose COPY becomes
    the starting point when the target section is absent, so an install still on
    the old key keeps its allow-list and thresholds across its first save instead
    of having them shadowed by a bare new section.

    ``drop_keys`` and ``blank_keys`` are the legacy plaintext-credential purge
    (``bot_token`` / ``app_password`` stored in ``config.json`` before the
    ``.env`` slot existed). They are decided against the document the write
    lands on, not the snapshot: a copy a concurrent writer landed after the
    handler's read is purged too, so clearing the ``.env`` credential cannot
    leave a fallback behind that a restart would authenticate with. ``drop``
    removes the key; ``blank`` sets it to ``""`` where present. Both are undone
    by ``restore``.

    ``finalize`` runs on the MERGED section, inside the lock, for a rule that
    couples the written keys to their stored counterparts (a soft/hard threshold
    pair): the pre-lock snapshot the handler validated against may not be the
    document the write lands on, so the coupled check has to be re-decided
    against the fresh one. It may adjust the section or raise; a raise aborts
    the write and propagates to the caller.

    Both run off the event loop through ``drained_to_thread``: the locked
    read-modify-write does file IO and may block on another process holding the
    lock, neither of which belongs on the loop, and a thread cannot be
    cancelled, so a cancelled request must not unwind (releasing
    ``_get_config_lock()`` and skipping its paired ``.env`` write) while the
    worker is still rewriting the file.

    Four gates, all fail-closed, in the order their evidence is cheapest:

    1. **A registered transport.** Expressed as membership in the registry, never
       as ``channel_type != "slack"``: a negation hands every channel added later
       whatever this path grants, in the permissive direction.
    2. **``supports_proactive_send``.** A channel whose reply is bound to an
       inbound token (WeCom) cannot originate a message at all, and saying so is
       better than a confusing platform error.
    3. **Governance.** The same ``channels``-scope chokepoint the mirror leg uses,
       fail-closed, so a profile that narrows after startup stops sends too.
    4. **The transport's own allow-list**, re-applied by
       ``resolve_configured_target``. The opaque id travelled through the browser
       or the model, and the config may have narrowed since it was minted.

    Every non-2xx body carries a machine-readable ``code``: backend strings have
    no i18n catalog path, so the caller needs something stable to branch on.

    The egress twin of ``api_delete_message``: same "the bot's own message"

    ``api_send_message``'s — ``redact_for_display`` over the text and
    ``_sanitize_blocks`` over the blocks, before either reaches Slack.

    Authorization is per target kind. A ROOM must be in the tracked-channel
    allowlist, which is the operator's revocation lever rather than only a
    first-contact check — without it a message the bot authored while the channel
    was tracked would stay a writable slot in it after the operator revoked egress.

    ``open_dm(owner_id)`` the send path uses, and fails closed when no owner is
    configured or the lookup raises. Admitting every ``D`` channel on its prefix
    would leave a FORMER owner's DM permanently writable, since ``owner_id``
    changes and the DM channel id does not.

    That is one notch stricter than the ``file_send`` Slack leg
    (``dashboard/upload_destination.py::resolve_slack``), which still passes DMs on
    the prefix. Deliberate: this endpoint publishes replacement content into a
    message that is already there, so a wrong audience is not merely a new message

    Called by the ``browser`` MCP tool. Body:
    ``{"op": str, "session_key": str, "args"?: object, "timeout_ms"?: int}``.
    ``session_key`` is the BARE slot key the Electron panel registers under (the
    tool resolves and namespace-strips it; the ``dashboard:``-namespaced form
    travels in the ``X-Session-Key`` header for the peer check). Enqueues the op
    on the command bus and awaits the native panel's result.

    Responses:
    - 200 ``{"id", "ok": true, "result": <any>}`` -- op ran and succeeded;
    - 200 ``{"id", "ok": false, "error": str}`` -- op ran but failed;
    - 503 ``{"code": "no_native_panel"}`` -- no Electron poller for this session,
      returned FAST so the tool falls back to playwright-cli;
    - 429 ``{"code": "queue_full"}`` / 504 ``{"code": "timeout"}``.

    Proven ``X-Internal-Secret`` only (``request["internal_auth"] is True``),

    browser-credentialed page on a ``local_only=False`` deployment where strict
    paths reclassify as mixed -- is rejected here. We do NOT additionally require
    a loopback ``request.remote``: the tool reaches the gateway over the AF_UNIX
    internal-API socket (0700 data home + kernel peer check), where
    ``request.remote`` is empty, so a loopback re-assert would 403 every op.

    it is kept from planting tokens. Answers the ``connected`` /

# allow_group, allowed_group_ids, soft_threshold_pct, session_folder) lives in

# booleans; raw values are write-only. The UI maps FEISHU_APP_SECRET onto the

#
# Group access is a SEPARATE axis from the DM allow-list here (unlike WeCom's

# names which ones. Both fail closed — allow_group with an empty list serves no
