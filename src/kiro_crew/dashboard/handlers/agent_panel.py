"""HTTP routes for a crew's webview.

Two halves with deliberately different auth, because they are different acts:

* **Publishing** (``/api/agent-panel/*``) is MCP-only and strict-internal. The
  crew a call writes to is derived from the CALLING SESSION's identity
  (``X-Session-Key``, vetted by ``_recognize_session``) and then from that
  session's agent -- never from the request body. So a crew can only ever
  publish its own webview, and raw HTTP with no recognized session identity is
  refused. Restricted (incognito/temporary/guest) sessions are refused too: a
  published panel is durable on-disk state, which is exactly what those modes
  promise not to leave behind.

  Both publish routes are listed in ``server._STRICT_INTERNAL_API_PATHS`` --
  without that entry the internal-secret call falls through to cookie auth and
  every publish fails with 403.

* **Reading** (``/api/members/{slug}/panel``) is an ordinary cookie-authed
  dashboard route, because the drawer is what reads it. It is a read: nothing
  under it can publish or edit a panel.

    """The key the SESSION REGISTRY holds this caller under, or ``""``.

    Two keyspaces one prefix apart, and only this function is allowed to know
    it. Dashboard SLOTS are keyed by the bare name -- what
    :func:`_normalize_slot_key` produces, since it strips the transport prefix --
    while the session REGISTRY is keyed by the full session key the thread runs
    under, ``dashboard:<slot key>`` (:func:`members.member_thread_session_alias`,
    the one derivation every out-of-turn touch of a member session goes
    through). A member DM is the only session the panel tool is ever mounted on,
    so handing the slot key to the registry misses for EVERY member, without
    exception: ``get_agent_selection`` then answers from its own ``session is
    None`` arm with ``("template", "")``, and the publish is refused for a reason
    that is not about crew binding at all.

    ``X-Session-Key`` is used unchanged, because it already IS that full key:
    every identity source ``mcp_core._resolve_session_key_strict`` accepts -- the
    gateway-injected caller context, the signed per-session token,
    ``KIROCREW_SESSION_KEY``, the HMAC host-pid sidecar -- yields one, and that
    gate requires its caller to send back the key it returned. Passing it through
    is also what every other reader of an allocation's selection does
    (``messaging``, ``solo_spawn``, ``subagent`` and the admission gate all hand
    over the session key as they received it).

    A bare slot name therefore resolves to nothing and the publish is refused
    ``session_not_resolved``. That refusal is the point rather than a gap to
    paper over: a bare key here would mean the strict identity gate returned
    something this route does not expect, and rescuing it by re-adding the prefix
    would hide exactly the anomaly the separated refusal exists to surface.

    Returns ``((slug, crew_name), None)`` or ``(None, refusal)``.

    The crew comes from the session's own agent binding, never from the body: a
    body-supplied name would let one crew publish a webview that presents as
    another's, and the whole point of a per-crew panel is that the operator can
    trust whose state they are reading.

    AUTHORIZATION FIRST, and it cannot be left to the route listing. The crew is
    resolved from a caller-CHOSEN ``X-Session-Key``, so the header is an identity
    claim rather than a lookup key: a caller holding only a dashboard cookie could
    name any live session and have this resolve to THAT crew, then overwrite its
    panel. Requiring ``request["internal_auth"]`` -- set by
    ``token_auth_middleware`` exclusively on a constant-time ``X-Internal-Secret``
    match -- closes the cookie and app-token-over-HTTP variants, and
    ``_deny_app_caller`` closes the one that gate does NOT: an internal caller
    whose identity resolves to an APP.

    Those two are not alternatives, and an earlier version of this docstring
    claimed they were ("never present on a cookie- or app-token-authenticated
    request"). ``token_auth`` sets ``internal_auth`` and then derives
    ``request["app"]`` IN THE SAME BRANCH, precisely so ownership guards
    downstream can see it -- so an app-owned agent granted the panel tools, whose
    slot's ``agent`` happens to name a crew, satisfied the secret gate and
    published as that crew. The read route already denied app callers; the write
    route asserted in prose that it did not need to.

    The panel slot is not always enough. A V2 member's key carries its private store
    generation, which is unique to that member, so the key names exactly one crew. The V1
    key is the slug alone, and slugification is many-to-one -- ``Oncall`` and ``oncall``
    reach one slug, and two agents may even carry one ``member_id`` -- so on V1 a single
    key is every colliding crew's key at once.

    The FOLD survives that, keeping a record per ownership digest, and the panel routes
    survive it by checking the digest on whatever they read. The card store cannot: it is
    keyed on the slot, and the slot carries no crew of its own, only a per-session
    identity. So a card built from one crew's record, stored on a shared key, is served by
    the owner-only card route as the OTHER crew's board -- one crew's state read under
    another's name, which is the defect :func:`kiro_crew.agent_panel.publish` exists to
    prevent, reappearing on the surface that has no digest to check.

    only safe answer: two means the key is shared, and none means no crew in this config
    claims it, so nothing here can say whose board it would be.

    Refusing costs the CARD and nothing else -- the drawer keeps its own slot and both

    file was never written, or was removed, or cannot be parsed.

    *owner_key* selects WHICH record, because one slot can carry two crews: the slot
    is the member slug's, and a crew whose persisted ``member_id`` is another crew's

    it to the same srcdoc builder the artifact frames use, which adds the strict
    CSP and the theme variables. Serving it as HTML here would invite loading it
    directly, outside the sandbox that makes it safe to render at all.

    The raw ``data`` object travels alongside the document, and the drawer's
    DOCKED summary is rendered from it natively rather than from the document.
    That is the whole reason it is here: a dashboard needs a full page to be
    legible (four tiles across, multi-column grids), and the panel hosting the
    docked view starts at 320px wide, which cannot host one without pushing the
    crew's most important line below the fold. Reading the summary from the data
    lets the panel show the few fields that matter, in the order the crew
    published them, as ordinary escaped text.

    Duplicating the data (it is also inside the document's island) is deliberate
    and bounded: ``publish`` caps it, and the alternative -- parsing it back out
    of the composed HTML -- would make the drawer a consumer of the template's
    markup. Insertion order survives because ``json.dumps`` does not sort keys
