    """Validate one folder and append it to the store under the folders lock.

    The single create path. Callers that build folders for the user — the folder
    API below, project scaffolding — go through here, so none of them can end up
    with weaker path validation, a dangling ``parent_id``, weaker app-ownership
    isolation, or an unserialized store write than the others get. What stays
    with the caller is what differs between them: the response shape, the audit
    entry, and when to push a slots update (once per folder for a single create,
    once for a whole scaffold).

    ``request_app`` is the calling app's identity (empty when a person is
    calling): it is stamped as ``owner_app`` and gates nesting under folders
    other apps own. Never taken from a request body — a caller that could name
    its own owner could name someone else's (see ``_folder_owner_app``).

    ``tags`` is a shape-checked list of tag ids the caller wants copied onto
    every new chat filed into this folder (the folder API validates the request
    shape and answers 400 ``tags_invalid`` itself). The AUTHORITATIVE vocabulary
    intersection still runs here, under ``tags_write_lock``, at the point of
    application — the invariant every tag consumer follows (see
    api_chat_slot_tags / the channel filing): a tag deletion committing between
    the caller's shape check and this write must not be persisted onto the new
    folder, and the strip pass a deletion runs cannot see a folder that is not
    yet in the store. Included in the folder dict only when the intersection is
    non-empty — the same optional-key shape as ``color``, so a tagless folder
    keeps the record it has on disk today.

    ``icon`` is an optional explicit emoji for the folder glyph, validated
    grapheme-exact like every stored icon and included in the folder dict only
    when non-empty — the same optional-key shape as ``color``. An absent icon
    never triggers generation: creation leaves the folder on the default
    glyph, and the only path that spawns the generator is an explicit
    ``regenerate_icon`` request against an existing folder.

    Returns:
        The created folder, exactly as it was appended to the store.

    ``unique_project_dir`` makes "one folder per directory" atomic: the check
    runs inside the locked append, so two concurrent creators of the same
    ``project_dir`` cannot both observe it absent and both persist a folder —
    the loser is refused with code ``folder_project_dir_exists`` and can read
    the winner's folder after the fact. Off by default because the folder API
    has always allowed a person to point two folders at one directory by hand;
    only a caller whose own contract is "additive, skip what exists" (the
    scaffold) opts in.

    ``require_resolved_project_dir`` refuses a ``project_dir`` whose validation
    resolves to a different path than the caller named (code
    ``folder_project_dir_moved``). A caller that sets it is asserting its input
    is already canonical — the scaffold passes paths its scan just resolved and
    walked, so a resolution that lands elsewhere means a path component was
    swapped (typically for a symlink) between the scan and this create, and
    persisting the resolved target would bind the folder to a directory the
    scan never confirmed. Off by default because the folder API proper accepts
    ``~`` and symlinked paths from a person by design; resolution moving those
    is the feature, not an attack.

    ``refuse_duplicate_name`` makes "one folder of this name per parent" atomic
    the same way: the sibling test runs inside the locked append, against EVERY
    sibling whoever owns it, and a collision raises
    :class:`FolderNameExistsError`. Names compare trimmed and case-folded, the
    rule the MCP path walk matches segments by. Off by default because the
    sidebar lets a person hold two folders of one name; the folder API turns it
    on for agent callers, whose mkdir -p would otherwise fork a duplicate when
    two walks race or when the caller cannot see the existing folder. When the
    one colliding sibling already belongs to the caller's own principal, it is
    returned instead (with ``"reused": True`` on the returned copy), so a lost
    race resolves to the winner's folder in the same request.

    ``home_slot`` is the caller's own session (see :func:`caller_home_slot`).
    A non-person principal may nest directly under the folder that session is
    filed in, even when the person owns that folder. The slot's ``folder_id``
    is read under the lock, where the parent is decided.

    Raises:
        FolderCreateError: if the folder was refused (unusable name, missing
            parent, unusable ``project_dir``, unknown color, non-emoji
            ``icon``, or a ``unique_project_dir`` collision).
        FolderOwnershipError: if an app tried to nest under a folder it does
            not own.
        FolderNameExistsError: if ``refuse_duplicate_name`` is set and the

    """POST /api/chat/folders/reorder -- set several folders' ``order`` atomically.

    The one way to express a reorder as a SINGLE transaction. ``PATCH
    /api/chat/folders/{id}`` takes one row per request, so a caller renumbering
    several siblings issues N requests with no transaction between them: a
    failure partway leaves the tree carrying a mix of old and new ``order``
    numbers until the action is repeated. This endpoint applies the whole list
    in one ``mutate_folders`` pass under the folder-store lock, all-or-none -- so
    a rejected row leaves the stored order exactly as it was, never half-applied.

    Body: ``{"orders": [{"id": str, "order": int}, ...]}``. Every entry is
    validated into a pending map BEFORE the lock is taken (the same shape
    discipline ``api_chat_folder_update`` uses for its single row), so a
    malformed request is a 400 that never touches the store.

    Ownership is re-decided per row INSIDE the lock, exactly as ``_apply`` does
    for one row: an app may reorder only the folders it owns, and a batch naming
    one it does not is refused whole. Row ownership is not the whole rule --
    repositioning a folder relocates its whole subtree, so a row the app owns
    whose descendants include the person's is refused too, the same violation
    the reparent PATCH refuses one level down. Both live here because the reorder
    that composes these writes is the one place under the lock that sees the
    subtree, so a positioning caller states the whole renumber as a single batch
    and relies on this endpoint to authorize it.

    Reorder touches only ``order``: it never reparents, renames, recolors or
    retags. A row naming a folder absent from the store is a 404 for the whole
    batch (the reorder the caller computed describes a tree that has since
    shifted), so no partial renumber lands against a shifted tree.
