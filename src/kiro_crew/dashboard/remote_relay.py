"""Run a local session's turn on a connected peer crew and mirror it back.

The shape of the thing
----------------------
A slot bound with ``executor == "remote"`` lives entirely in the LOCAL product —
local sidebar row, local transcript, local history and search, local theme — but
its turns are executed by a peer gateway reached over an already-open instance
tunnel. This module is the seam: it POSTs the turn to the peer, reads the peer's
SSE stream, and replays it locally so that every existing frontend consumer
(``chatSlice``, ``useWebSocket``) sees exactly the frames a local turn produces
and needs no branch for "this session is remote".

Two channels arrive interleaved on the one stream:

* **transcript rows** — what the peer appended to its own window
  (``user``/``assistant``/``chunk``/``thinking``/``error``/…). These are replayed
  as local ``slot.append`` calls, which is what makes the local transcript a true
  mirror and gets the conversation into local history for free.
* **mirrored WebSocket frames** — everything a turn says about itself that is not
  a transcript row (``tool_call``, ``tool_result``, ``chat_segment``,
  ``chat_done`` …), carried in band because the peer was asked for them with
  ``?relay=1``. See :mod:`kiro_crew.dashboard.remote_mirror`. These are
  re-broadcast locally with the slot key rewritten to the LOCAL key.

Why the peer runs in SSE mode
-----------------------------
The peer's WebSocket transport would require proxying ``/api/ws`` — a
long-lived, differently-authenticated, differently-framed channel that the
instance proxy does not carry. Its SSE transport is a plain HTTP response the
existing tunnel already streams chunk by chunk, and the peer runs the turn
detached from the request either way, so nothing is lost by choosing it.

What is deliberately NOT here
-----------------------------
Resume-attach. If the local gateway restarts mid-turn, the peer keeps running
(that is the upside of the split) but this relay's reader is gone and the local
transcript stops at the last row it saw. Rejoining needs the peer's in-flight
tail, which is a separate concern from dispatch; the turn is not lost on the peer
and the next local send re-synchronises the visible conversation.

What a restart is NOT allowed to be is *silent*, which is the two things this
module does do about it (see :func:`relay_remote_turn` and
:func:`peer_is_connected`):

* An in-flight turn is marked with ``slot._relay_in_flight``, persisted before
  the stream opens and cleared when it ends. On reload a slot still carrying the
  marker gets an explicit "interrupted by a restart" row appended
  (``chat_persistence`` rehydrate), so the transcript never just stops mid-turn.
* A remote session is LOCKED while its tunnel is down — the send path refuses a
  turn with a "reconnecting" 409 until ``peer_is_connected`` is true — so a user
  cannot fire a fresh turn into a half-open tunnel a restart has not rebuilt yet.
