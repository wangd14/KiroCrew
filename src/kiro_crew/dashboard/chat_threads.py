"""Reply threads on crewmate chat messages: HTTP handlers and the crewmate's turn.

A thread is the set of replies attached to ONE message of a crewmate's chat
(a member-mode slot), addressed by that message's durable ``meta.mid``.
Replies live in a sidecar beside the slot's transcript, owned by
``ConversationLog.read_threads`` / ``append_thread_reply`` (which write under
the transcript's own lock), and never enter ``slot.messages``: the main chat
shows only what the crewmate says to the user, and a thread is where one of
those messages gets discussed.

Posting a reply runs the crewmate's turn in an isolated ``thread:<slot>:<mid>``
session with the parent message, the main-chat context around it and the
thread so far as its envelope; the crewmate's answer lands in the same thread.
The turn runs under the side chat's tool posture -- read-only on the kiro
harness, no tools elsewhere -- because the thread panel has no approval card
to fall back to. Actions still go through the main chat.
