"""Threads: an ordinary chat session anchored to one message of another conversation.

A thread is not a container. It is a RELATION -- ``(surface, conversation,
message_id)`` -- between one message and one ordinary session that hangs off it.
The session is minted through the same core ``session_create`` uses, so it has
everything a chat surface has by construction: tools, approval cards, a model, a
steer channel, a queue, memory, a transcript and a place in the sidebar.

Two halves live here:

* the **anchor index** (``ConversationLog.read_thread_anchors`` and friends), a
  sidecar beside the parent's transcript recording which slot each message's
  thread lives in, so a conversation can list its threads in one read; and
* :func:`open_thread`, the one coroutine both openers call -- the user clicking a
  message (``POST /api/chat/threads/{mid}/open``) and an agent opening a thread on
  the message it is answering (MCP ``thread_open``).

Opening never touches the running turn. It holds no semaphore, does not gate on
``has_active_turn()``, and is not a mid-turn message primitive: it mints a
SIBLING session and takes a non-consuming SNAPSHOT of the parent's partial text
(:func:`in_flight_snapshot`). A streaming assistant row has no ``mid`` yet -- ids
are minted post-turn -- so a thread opened on one anchors to the user message
that started that turn, which is where the work was asked for anyway, and the
partial reply travels into the seed as quoted context.

Version 1's threads (replies in the sidecar, answered by a cold read-only
``thread:<slot>:<mid>`` session) are read in place and never rewritten. They
render as a read-only fold; nothing migrates them, because replaying them as a
session's transcript would assert a history that session never had.

    Nothing is injected at open. A thread learns what it hangs off at its FIRST

    written to next week discusses next week's parent, and a thread beside a busy
    parent is not carrying a quote of one old message forever.

    *note* is whatever the opener actually SAID, and it is delivered as the
    thread's own first user message. That is what gives it the parent chat's queue
    receipt: it travels the ordinary send path, so the thread's composer shows
    exactly what any chat shows. A bare click delivers nothing and leaves the
    thread waiting for its reader, as the drawer's empty hint says it will.

    *in_flight* says the caller resolved this anchor from a streaming turn rather
    than from a row the person pointed at, and only the caller can know it: by
    the time the anchor arrives here it is an ordinary ``mid`` either way. It
    reaches the ``thread/opened`` entry and nothing else -- the anchor index
    projects to a fixed field set (:func:`~kiro_crew.history._thread_anchor_row`)
    and has no room for it, so a reader asking which anchors were resolved has
    the crew log to ask.

    The one implementation both openers call. In order:

    1. resolve the anchored conversation and confirm the anchor is admissible
       (read-only probe, so a refusal costs no session);
    2. mint the thread's slot through ``session_control.create_session`` -- the
       same core ``session_create`` uses. NOT ``session_fork``: fork copies the
       whole parent transcript and refuses an ``agent`` override, while a thread
       wants a curated seed and an optional agent;
    3. record the anchor in the parent's anchor index, which is the ONE record of
       the relation on this surface, and what lets the parent list its threads in
       one read. A late refusal here retracts the session;
    4. emit ``thread/opened`` and announce the anchor to the dashboard; then
    5. deliver the opener's note, when there is one.

    Returns ``{"thread_slot", "anchor", "title", "seeded"}``, where ``seeded``
    says whether a note was delivered.
