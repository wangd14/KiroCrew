"""Auto-compaction notice delivery for channel-originated sessions.

``SessionManager`` fires its compact callback for EVERY session it compacts, but
the dashboard's handler only knows how to append to a chat slot — so a session
living on Slack or Discord had its context compacted silently: no notice, and no
explanation for the summarized history the user sees afterwards. This module is
the channel leg of that notice.

Delivery reuses the two existing outbound paths rather than adding a third:

* **Slack** — ``state.slack_client.post_message`` into the thread persisted by
  the inbound leg (``SessionMap.get_slack_link``), the same resolution the
  linked-thread auth-error notice uses. Slack is deliberately absent from the
  ``channel_transports`` registry, so it cannot ride the ladder below.
* **every other channel** — the governed cross-surface ladder
  (``chat_runner._resolve_channel_target``), which vets the send against the
  ``channels`` governance scope, records a SEL decision for grant AND denial,
  and checks ``supports_proactive_send`` before handing off to
  ``Transport.send_message``. The target is the session's ``origin`` link,
  recorded by the transport's inbound path.

Best-effort by construction: the compaction itself already succeeded and the
session keeps running, so a failed or impossible delivery is logged and
swallowed rather than surfaced.
