"""Rewind — edit a past user message and re-run from that point in place.

Unlike ``edit_resend`` (which truncates ``slot.messages`` in memory but
leaves the backing kiro-cli session file with stale forward turns),
``rewind`` swaps the underlying ACP session for a fresh one. This mirrors
kiro-cli's native ``/rewind`` slash command, which "rewinds the conversation
to a previous turn, forks into a new session" — except the *user-visible*
slot identity (key, title, folder, sidebar position) is preserved. The
orphaned kiro-cli session file is deleted so it does not pollute
``kiro-cli chat -l`` / the resume picker.

Contract:
- ``POST /api/chat/slots/{slot}/rewind``
- Body: ``{at_message_index: int, content: str}`` (or ``{ts, content}``)
- Prepares and persists the truncated history before replacing the live slot,
  discards the current ACP conversation, deletes the orphaned kiro-cli session
  file (best-effort), and re-runs from the edited prompt against a fresh ACP
  session.
