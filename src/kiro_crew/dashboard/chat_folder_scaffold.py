"""Folder scaffolding from a project tree — preview, then create.

Two endpoints sit on top of :mod:`kiro_crew.project_scan`:

* ``POST /api/project-scaffold/scan`` — dry-run preview. Runs the scanner and
  returns what a scaffold WOULD create, with nothing created.
* ``POST /api/project-scaffold/create`` — creates the confirmed selection by
  composing the existing folder create path.

The split is what makes the feature safe to point at an unfamiliar tree: a scan
is read-only, so the destructive-sounding half of "build me twenty folders" only
happens against a selection the user has seen.

Three properties belong to this module rather than to the scanner:

* **The scan root is validated by the folder API's own validator.** ``scan``
  refuses exactly what creating a folder by hand refuses — a relative path, a
  sensitive path, a path that is not a directory — because it calls the same
  :func:`~kiro_crew.dashboard.chat_folders._validate_project_dir`. One function,
  and the message the user reads is the one they would have read anyway.
* **Reconcile marking is an overlay, not a detection rule.** The scanner's
  output depends only on the filesystem and the passed configuration, which is
  what makes two scans of an unchanged tree compare equal. Which candidates
  already have folders is store state, so it is layered on here — a candidate is
  marked ``existing`` and drops out of the default selection, but it is still
  reported, because "already set up" is information the user wants.
* **The scanner owns its own bounds.** ``project_scan`` carries the depth bound
  as its own default rather than taking it from configuration, so the scan's
  result is a function of the filesystem and the root alone. A tunable belongs
  here, in the caller, if a need for one is ever filed.
* **A selection is re-derived, not trusted.** ``scaffold`` scans again and keeps
  only the selected paths the fresh scan offers, then creates folders on the
  scanner's own paths. A client can pick from what the server found; it cannot
  name the directory a folder is created on.
