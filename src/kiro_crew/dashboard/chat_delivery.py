"""Delivery of a user message into a chat slot, independent of the caller.

The interesting cases are all in the bookkeeping: a mid-turn steer has to be
registered before the RPC suspends, the transcript segment has to be cut at the
steer boundary, and a steer the live client refuses must fall through to the
queue rather than vanish. Held here rather than inside the route handler so the
bookkeeping can be tested against a slot directly, without an HTTP request, and
so a second delivery caller inherits it rather than growing a second copy that
drifts until a message is silently dropped.

The helpers own that bookkeeping and nothing else — no HTTP, no request parsing,
no response shaping — so a caller layers its own authorization and response
format on top.

    Returns None while this steer still has an entry in ``_steer_delivery_ids``:
    that entry lives from registration until the persisting tail pops it, so its

    When two or more LIVE steers share the sanitized content, this returns None and

    in-flight guard admits one steer per RAW text while a peer steer's row stores
    the SANITIZED text, so two peer steers differing only in credential material
    are both admitted with byte-identical rows -- the same injectivity loss

    Requires a live, steer-capable inner ACP client that the turn published on
    the slot. Fire-and-forget by design: the inline steer card materializes when
    kiro-cli echoes ``steering_consumed``.

    ``send_id`` is the client-minted correlation id from the send's meta (the
    same ``sendId`` convention the plain send path persists). When present it is
    stamped onto the persisted steer row AND the ``steer_push`` broadcast, so the
    client can reconcile its optimistic bubble — and resolve the bubble's
    accepted-vs-new-turn ambiguity — by id identity instead of text. Optional
    and additive: a send without one keeps the exact prior row/payload shape.
    Normalized at entry (``normalize_send_id``) so the type/length bound holds
    for every caller, not just the current one.

    ``user_origin`` says whether this text was typed by the session's OWN human.
    The composer passes True and the ``session_send`` peer path passes False. The
    requeue is what needs it: ``directive_user_origin`` on the queue entry exempts
    it from the drain's LINKED drop, and that exemption is justified by the author
    having typed into the session's own surface. A peer's steer has no such author,
    so the flag has to be told apart per caller rather than read off the slot, which
    cannot distinguish the two.

    Defaults to FALSE so the human's exemption is the one thing a caller cannot
    acquire by saying nothing. A default of True would put the same trap one layer
    down: correct for whichever callers exist, wrong for the next one.

    ``admission`` is the containment that held when the caller's gate cleared this
    send (``session_control.containment_meta``). It is recorded for the REQUEUE,
    which runs in the turn's teardown -- on the far side of this function's
    suspension -- and would otherwise read the slot again and fold a mirror linked
    during that suspension into the entry's admission baseline, after which the
    drain reads the widened audience as one the authorization saw.

    Both callers pass it, and the requeue reads NOTHING else: a slot read there is
    not a fallback, so there is one baseline rather than two. An absent stamp
    therefore means the entry carries no containment key at all, which puts it on the
    drain's documented fail-closed floor (checked against every currently held
    constraint) rather than on the slot read this exists to remove. That matters
    because the LINKED exemption does not cover the case: a new outbound mirror is
    never exempt, since the author does not control mirror links.

    ``decision_strip`` is the ``message.steer`` decision row that chose THIS path
    (``decisions/points/message_steer.py``), stamped onto the persisted row as
    ``meta.decisions_strip`` so the transcript carries the receipt for it. Absent
    for every other caller and for a manual steer, which is what keeps their rows
    byte-identical.

    *send_id* is the client-minted ``meta.sendId`` the plain send path persists
    on its user row, already passed through ``normalize_send_id`` by the caller.
    When present it is stamped onto the queue entry's meta: the drain unions
    every consumed entry's meta onto the row it writes, so this is what gives a
    QUEUED send's row the same ``meta.sendId`` a dispatched send's row gets --
    without it the drained row is id-less and a client that sent into a busy
    slot has no identity to prove its own delivery by (it would have to fall
    back to text, which a same-text resend or an injection can share). Additive:
    a send whose POST carried no usable id stores nothing here and the entry
    meta keeps the exact prior shape.

    *attachments* is the client's ordered attachment lists (``files``, ``dirs``),
    already reduced to lists of strings by ``attachment_meta``. Same reasoning
    as the id: a dispatched send persists ``meta.files`` on its row, and the
    renderer resolves each ``[attached_file N] path`` marker LOSSLESSLY against
    that list. A queued send's row had no such list, so the renderer fell back
    to a whitespace-bounded capture of the marker text and a path with a space
    (``/tmp/My Report.pdf``) came back as ``/tmp/My`` -- an attachment card that
    opens nothing. Stamping the lists onto the entry rides them onto the row.

    *decision_strip* is the ``message.steer`` decision row that chose THIS path
    (``decisions/points/message_steer.py``). It rides the entry meta for exactly
    the reason the id and the attachment lists do: the drain unions entry meta onto
    the row it appends, so this is the only way a QUEUED send's row carries the
    receipt for the decision that queued it. Absent on every send that was not
    decided, which keeps the entry's prior shape.

    Called from both places a prompt is accepted onto a slot queue: the busy-slot
    path in this module, and the sub-agent hold branch in ``chat_handlers``. Both
    answer the sender a receipt saying whether the entry is durable, so both must
    start the write that makes it so; a receipt from one path and a write from
    only the other is the asymmetry this seam exists to prevent.

    The prompt's transcript row is written by the DRAIN, so between this accept
    and that drain the queue is the ONLY record of the user's words. Waiting for
    the periodic flush would leave that window as wide as the flush interval, and
    a gateway restart inside it is exactly how the prompt disappears.

    Started, not awaited. This function's caller answers the send synchronously,
    and the acknowledgment keeps the repository's existing meaning — accepted in
    memory, durable on a flush (``_save_slot_to_history``: "an edit is
    acknowledged when it lands in memory and persists on a later flush") — so
    the residual window is now one save's duration rather than one interval's.
    Making it a precondition instead would mean refusing a queued send on a slow
    or failing disk, which takes the user's words away at the one moment they
    cannot be re-read from the transcript.

    Self-limiting: the save is skipped unless the slot is dirty or its queue
    drifted from disk, so a burst of queued sends does not become a burst of
    transcript rewrites, and anything this pass skips stays owed to the periodic
    flush.

    Single-flight per slot. Two writers would each snapshot the queue
    independently, and the transcript's file lock orders their COMMITS, not their
    reads: the writer that snapshotted ``[q1]`` can acquire the lock after the one
    that snapshotted ``[q1, q2]`` and put the older value back. The drift check
    still leaves ``q2`` owed to the periodic flush, so nothing is lost forever —
    but a restart inside that interval loses an acknowledged prompt, which is the
    whole window this function exists to close. So one writer STARTED HERE runs
    per slot at a time and a send arriving mid-write records the debt for it to
    settle.

    Its scope is exactly that, and no wider: the periodic ``_flush_dirty_slots``
    pass and ``chat_summary``'s own ``flush_slot_now`` are separate writers that
    this flag does not gate, so an immediate write can still interleave with one
    of those. What that interleaving cannot do is put an older queue value back on
    disk: inside ``_locked(history_key)`` the save compares the slot's
    committed-queue witness against the value it held when it read the queue and
    refuses when another writer has committed in between
    (``_queue_snapshot_is_stale``). A refused pass leaves the queue owed by the
    drift check, so losing that race costs one flush interval of lag rather than
    an acknowledged prompt.
