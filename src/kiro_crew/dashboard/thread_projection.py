"""What a thread's model sees of its parent conversation, and when.

A thread is a full session, so the parent's history is not its history: nothing
is injected when the thread opens, and nothing is ever injected verbatim. Both
follow from sessions being perpetual -- a thread opened on a message deep in a
long parent would otherwise carry a copy of that parent's transcript forever,
and every later turn would pay for it again.

What the thread's FIRST turn gets instead is one summary block, built here from
three bands:

* the parent's own compaction summary, reused rather than re-derived, when the
  parent has one -- it is the parent's best existing account of what came before
  the window, and paying a model to summarize a summary buys nothing;
* the anchor window: the rows around the message the thread hangs off, with the
  anchor itself weighted, because that message is the reason the thread exists;
* everything after the anchor, chunk-folded -- summarized in groups so a parent
  that ran for a thousand rows since the anchor still fits the budget.

Every later turn gets only the delta: the rows the parent appended since the
cursor this module recorded. An empty delta injects NOTHING, rather than a block
saying nothing happened -- a thread sitting beside an idle parent must not pay a
block per turn for the privilege.

Addressing is by the parent's crew-log ``seq``, not by message id: the crew log's
``message/received`` entry carries no ``mid`` (its emitter deliberately does not
run where a slot appends, because there is no session id yet), so the anchor's
position cannot be looked up from its id at all. It is resolved ONCE when the
thread opens -- by TIME, the last parent entry at or before the anchor row's
timestamp -- and written into the anchor index, which is the cursor from then on.

Resolving by time rather than by correlating the Nth transcript row with the Nth
``message/*`` entry, because that correlation is broken by exactly the things a
long parent does: compaction rewrites the transcript, rewind and regenerate drop
rows from it, and neither touches the append-only log. Resolving once at open
rather than on each first turn, because a thread opened today may first be
written to after the parent compacted its anchor row away, and a timestamp with
no row to match is not resolvable. Seconds of precision is all the bands
need; the anchor's own text is exact regardless, because it comes from the
parent's TRANSCRIPT -- the log gives the position, the transcript gives the body.

Exact rows stay reachable without any of this: a thread carries a handle (parent
slot key, anchor mid, parent turn id) and the ``thread_context_read`` tool reads
the real rows on demand. The projection is the cheap always-on account; the tool
is the precise one, and a model that needs the exact bytes asks for them.

Model-free by construction: the summarizer is a callable seam, so every band,
budget and cursor rule in here is unit-testable without a model.

    # in the buffer. Lose that write and the next turn reads the old cursor and

    # below suspends only THIS turn -- the event loop keeps serving everything else,
