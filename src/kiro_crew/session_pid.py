    A thin delegate to ``platform_compat.get_process_start_id``, which is

    macOS) — deliberately NOT ``ps``, so the token lookup itself is non-blocking
    and safe to call from the asyncio event loop. (Whether an enclosing tracker
    may run on the loop is governed by that tracker's exclusive file lock, not
    by this lookup — see ``AUTOSDE: no-blocking-call-on-event-loop``.)

    Returns ``None`` when identity cannot be determined, meaning a process we may
    not introspect or a read that failed. Every platform Crew supports HAS a
    source — ``/proc`` on Linux, ``libproc`` on macOS, the creation FILETIME on
    Windows — so ``None`` is a failed read rather than an unsupported host.
    Callers MUST treat ``None`` as "unknown", never as a mismatch — see the sweep
    call sites.

    Note this cannot reuse ``acp.client._get_start_time``: that hashes with
    builtin ``hash()``, which is PYTHONHASHSEED-randomized per interpreter and
    therefore meaningless once written to disk and compared by a later gateway.

    SUBTRACTIVE ONLY. A live value that differs from the recorded one proves the PID
    was recycled and prunes the entry without a signal; a value that MATCHES never
    authorizes one, because the tracking file is same-uid-writable and this token is
    readable from ``/proc`` for any introspectable PID. What authorizes a kill is the
    argv test plus each arm's own reparent or gateway-liveness condition.

    That rule is also why the Linux value needs no boot scope here: it counts
    ``/proc`` start ticks from BOOT, so a post-reboot PID can repeat an earlier
    boot's pair — which under subtractive use costs a missed prune, not a wrong kill.

    recognises every registered harness (``_MANAGED_AGENT_BASENAMES``, projected from
    the backend registry) wherever a command line is readable, and on Windows only an
    image name is -- so an interpreter-hosted adapter reads as ``node.exe`` there and a

    identity to offer it proves nothing about who holds the number, and the sweep
    prunes a stale tokened line by liveness on its own.

    A refused replacement RAISES, like a refused append: failing to record a live

    one, so ``node app.js --require /any/path`` would offer ``/any/path`` as the script
    slot, and a path an unrelated process merely MENTIONS would authorize a SIGKILL of it.
    Telling a value-taking option from a boolean one needs a table of Node's flags, which
    is an open set and a moving one; the position is closed and is the shape Crew produces.

    A leading ``-`` at index 1 therefore opens no slot: Crew never emits one, so that
    command line is not ours to reason about.

    What is excluded is the rest of argv. A process's arguments are chosen by whoever
    started it and say nothing about what it IS, so ``node build.js --agent goose`` or an
    editor opened on a file called ``dsh`` would otherwise be answered "this is a harness"

    whether the root process itself was sent SIGKILL.

    ``expected_start`` is the root's process-start identity as the CALLER read it,
    and passing it pins that identity across this function instead of only up to its
    door. A caller that verified the pid immediately before calling still hands over
    a verdict with an expiry: the descendant walk below is a ``pgrep``, unbounded in
    time, and the root's own signal happens after it. A candidate that exits inside
    that walk frees its number, and a managed runtime taking the number next passes
    the argv gate -- it IS one of ours -- so the root signal lands on an unrelated
    live session. Re-checked before the walk and again immediately before the root
    signal, which is the rule :func:`_root_identity_holds` states for the sibling
    teardown: before EVERY signal, not once up front.

    Every signal this function sends is judged against a freshly read identity, because
    a verdict older than the last syscall is a verdict about a pid that may have changed
    hands. The ROOT is checked before the descendant read, so a pid that has already
    moved is not walked; again after that read, because the read is itself a window --
    one procfs children read, or a ``pgrep`` spawn -- and a recycled pid hands over a
    stranger's child list; and again immediately before the root signal. Each CHILD
    carries its own token, read when it was discovered, and is re-checked against that
    token before it is signalled: the argv gate answers from cmdline, so it says a pid
    is the KIND of process we manage, never that it is the one just found.

    Subtractive, exactly as the token rule below requires. It only ever WITHHOLDS a
    signal: an identity that differs, or that cannot be read at all, stops the kill
    and the caller sees zero killed. Omitted -- the default -- leaves every existing
    caller's behaviour untouched, because a caller with no captured identity has
    nothing to compare and this adds no evidence it did not have.

    The argv gate below is a PID-RECYCLE guard and the only thing that authorizes a
    signal here: it asks whether this PID still names the kind of process the
    tracking entry described. :data:`_MANAGED_AGENT_MARKERS` is projected from the
    backend registry, so it answers for every harness Crew spawns rather than for
    two of them.

    A recorded start token does NOT authorize a kill anywhere in this module, by
    design. It is subtractive evidence only — a live token that differs from the
    recorded one proves the PID was recycled, and the entry is pruned without a
    signal — because the tracking file is same-uid-writable and a token is readable
    from ``/proc`` for any introspectable PID, so a matching token is not a
    capability this file's contents may confer. That is the rule
    ``kiro_pids.txt``'s own arm follows, and ``session.md`` states it for both.

    (see :func:`_signal_orphaned_runtime_group`).

    *instance* is the per-spawn ``KIROCREW_SPAWN_INSTANCE`` the runtime put on
    its root's environment, and a member counts only if it carries that exact
    value. The generic ``KIROCREW_SPAWNED`` marker proves a group is SOME Kiro
    Crew runtime's; it cannot prove it is this one's, because every runtime here
    is a marked session leader and a root pid released to a fresh spawn names a
    group that carries the marker just as well. The instance is what tells them
    apart. An empty *instance* matches nothing.

    The proof a teardown needs once the group's LEADER is gone. A leader spawned
    with ``start_new_session=True`` names its group by its own pid, so the number
    survives the leader -- but a bare number is what a recycled pid looks like
    too, and ``killpg`` on it would take a stranger's tree. A member that carries
    ``KIROCREW_SPAWNED`` in its exec-time environment is the positive identity
    that a group is one Kiro Crew spawned; a detached survivor that merely
    inherited the marker is excluded by the argv identity check, the same pair
    the tracked sweep's systemd arm requires.

    Linux only. The environ read is Linux-only and fail-closed everywhere else,
    so the answer is ``{}`` on macOS and Windows and the caller signals nothing
    -- a missed reap there, never a wrong kill. Zombies are skipped: they hold
    no memory and cannot be signalled into exiting.

    *require_runtime_identity* is the ARGV gate
    (:func:`_tracked_child_has_runtime_identity`), on by default because it is the
    shape the ACP runtime's own group has. A caller whose tree is not an agent
    runtime turns it OFF -- an app backend's members are whatever its manifest runs
    (a uvicorn worker, a build subprocess), so requiring the runtime shape excludes
    every one of them and the reap reaches nothing. Turning it off is not "no
    identity": the group and instance checks above still apply and are already
    conclusive, because the instance is a fresh value per spawn and cannot be
    inherited from an earlier or later incarnation of the same group number. The
    ACP path's reason for the extra gate -- an intentional survivor that merely
    inherited the TREE-WIDE ``KIROCREW_SPAWNED`` marker -- does not reach a member
    of THIS group: a process that deliberately detaches calls ``setsid`` and

    """Signal a runtime's group members after its leader has been reaped, if ours.

    The kill path that signals a live tree is ``killpg(getpgid(root))``, and it
    has a hole exactly where the leak lives: ``getpgid`` raises once the root has
    exited, the caller reads that as "already dead", and the launcher, agent and
    chat processes left in the group are never signalled. They reparent to init
    holding their memory, and if the root died before any descendant was
    recorded there is no tracking entry to find them by either.

    So resolve the group from the contract instead of from the dead pid -- the
    root was a session leader, so ``pgid == root pid`` -- and find its members
    through :func:`_marked_group_members`, which vouches each one by *instance*:
    the per-spawn token the runtime put on its root's environment, which its
    whole tree inherited. Then signal THOSE MEMBERS, each re-verified by start id
    at the instant of the signal -- not the group number. The number is the
    reaped root's pid and can be handed to a fresh session leader at any moment,
    including between the vouch and the signal; a member's pid plus its start
    instant cannot be. No vouching member means no signal: declining to act
    costs a leak the sweep still reports, where acting costs an unrelated
    process. ``pgid`` is still refused for 0, 1 and our own group, since a
    member listing keyed on one of those would be a listing of the wrong thing.

    The instance is the incarnation pin, and it is what the generic marker
    cannot supply. Every runtime here is a marked session leader, so a root pid
    released and handed to a fresh spawn names a group that carries the marker
    just as well -- and a signal aimed by the number and the marker alone would
    terminate that fresh runtime's live session. A fresh spawn carries a
    different instance, so it does not vouch for this one's group.

    An escalation additionally passes the members the first pass vouched, as
    *expected*, and signals only those of them still alive under the same start
    id -- nothing found for the first time now: the instance proves the
    incarnation, the start id proves the pass is looking at the same processes,
    and a process that was not signalled on the first pass owes no escalation.

    Returns ``(vouched, signalled)``: the live members the vouch FOUND, and the
    subset a signal was actually delivered to -- the latter being the value a
    caller hands back as *expected*. A member that exited between the vouch and the
    signal, or whose identity stops reading as vouched, is skipped; so is one
    whose signal the kernel REFUSED, which is why the two maps are reported
    separately. A teardown that only has to clear its own state can ignore the
    census (see :func:`_signal_orphaned_runtime_group`); a caller deciding whether
    to keep an orphan's only record cannot, because an empty ``signalled`` alone
    cannot say whether the group is gone or merely unreachable right now.

    *require_runtime_identity* is passed through to :func:`_marked_group_members`;
    a caller whose tree is not an agent runtime turns it off. See
    :func:`signal_orphaned_spawn_group`, the public entry point for those.

    Every other guarantee is the one the ACP path makes and is deliberately not

    means the members are alive and the kernel refused (a later attempt can

    into one count is how a refusal comes to look like a completed reap.

    Callers must stamp a fresh ``KIROCREW_SPAWN_INSTANCE`` on the tree's root at
    spawn time and persist it with the pid they will later reap by; without the
    token there is no identity to vouch with and both maps come back empty. Check

    A zombie answers every liveness probe as present until someone waits on it.
    ``ChildProcessError`` means the process is not ours to reap (or asyncio's
    child watcher got there first), which is not a failure here.

    Identity is re-checked immediately before the wait, for the same reason every
    signal re-checks it: that watcher can reap the leader zombie on its own, which
    frees the pid, and ``waitpid`` on a recycled pid consumes an UNRELATED child's
    exit status. That loss is silent and nothing detects or repairs it, so this
    reads the identity here rather than trusting the one taken at entry.

    WHY THE RE-READ IS ENOUGH, on every platform. Linux keeps ``/proc/<pid>/stat``
    readable for a zombie. macOS ``proc_pidinfo`` refuses one, so
    :func:`platform_compat.get_process_start_id` falls back to ``sysctl``, which
    reads the same start instant from the kernel's zombie list. Either way the
    identity of the state this teardown CREATES -- a killed root held unreaped to
    keep its pgid unambiguous -- survives the exit and the check passes for the case
    this exists to handle.

    Where an identity cannot be read at all, refusing is deny-by-default working as
    designed, not a gap to route around. An unreadable identity is exactly the case
    where a recycled pid cannot be told from our own zombie: a freed pid can be taken
    by another child of THIS process that is itself an unreaped zombie, and that
    occupant reads as unreadable too, so a wait would steal its exit status and its
    own watcher would report a code that never happened.

    What such a refusal leaves behind is a ZOMBIE, which has already released its
    memory: one process-table entry and an exit status, bounded by pid space and
    gone when this process exits. That is not the leak this teardown exists to
    close -- that one is a RUNNING descendant holding hundreds of megabytes with no
    tracking entry left to find it by. And the entry is not necessarily permanent:
    asyncio's child watcher may still reap it afterwards, since the root is this
    process's child. A benign bounded entry is the cheaper side of the trade.

    has confirmed gone. Passing neither *pids* nor *drop* writes nothing.

    Field 3 is :func:`_recorded_start_token` of the mapping's VALUE, so the

    are: between the caller's liveness probe and this write the kernel can hand
    the same number to a replacement root this gateway just tracked, and a

    *child_map* is a SNAPSHOT, and it is reused across every candidate root in

    process and is dropped with its subtree. The PPid and the start token come
    from ONE ``stat`` read (:func:`_pid_parent_and_token`) so they cannot
    describe two different processes.

    Iterative, not recursive: an orphan chain deeper than Python's recursion
    limit would raise ``RecursionError``, which the caller's ``except`` clause
    does not name and which fires BEFORE the root is signalled -- aborting the

    all of ``/proc`` per tree. The map is read-only here, so it is safe to share
    across sequential/threaded calls. Any PID in *exclude_pids* is skipped along
    with its subtree. Resident pages are summed across the tree and converted to
    MiB once at the end.

    """Total RSS (MiB) of *pid* plus its descendant tree, via ``/proc``.

    Single-tree convenience: builds the parent->child map with one
    ``/proc/*/stat`` scan (see ``_build_child_map``) and delegates to
    ``_rss_mb_from_tree``. To measure MANY trees in one sweep, build the map
    once with ``_build_child_map()`` and call ``_rss_mb_from_tree()`` per tree so
    ``/proc`` is scanned only once, not once per tree.

    Any PID in *exclude_pids* is skipped along with the entire subtree beneath
    it — a defensive barrier so a caller can exclude a shared sub-tree (e.g. a
    pooled backend). Resident pages are summed and converted to MiB once at the
    end, so the reading is not biased downward by per-PID truncation.

    *proc_root* overrides the ``/proc`` mount (test seam only).

    Linux reads ``/proc``. Windows has neither ``/proc`` nor a safe parent->child
    walk (see ``_build_child_map``), so it delegates to
    ``platform_compat.proc_rss_tree_mb_for_pid``, which sums only
    lineage-validated descendants; without that the ceiling measured every tree
    as 0 MiB there and no session was ever recycled. macOS has no ctypes-only
    per-pid RSS path, so it returns 0 and the ceiling stays inert.

    *exclude_pids* is honoured on the ``/proc`` route. The Windows route derives
    its own validated descendant set, so a caller that needs a subtree barrier
    there must exclude the pid before calling.
