"""Application discovery and OS-resolved identity, from the window list ONLY.

Two jobs, and the second is security-critical:

1. :func:`list_apps` / :func:`resolve_app` answer "which applications have a
   visible window, and which pid owns the one the agent named".
2. :func:`resolve_identity` produces the **OS-resolved** bundle id and display
   name that ``computer_use/gate.py`` queries governance on. The gate never
   queries the agent-supplied ``app`` string: if it did, an allow-listed
   ``com.apple.finder`` could be satisfied by a model claiming "finder" while the
   automation actually drove something else. Everything here answers "what did we
   really touch", not "what were we asked for".

**Never a process-name search.** Not ``pgrep``, not ``ps``, not a name scan of
any kind — the string does not appear in this module and a test asserts that.
The reason is a reproduced failure, not a style preference: ``pgrep -n "Google
Chrome"`` returned 47492, a short-lived helper process that answered
``kAXErrorCannotComplete`` to every accessibility read and then exited, while the
real browser was 637. Slack's helper 1614 likewise shadowed the real 942. The pid
that owns a visible, layer-0 window is the one whose accessibility tree is
populated, so the CoreGraphics window list is the only source of truth.

Bundle-id resolution is a **live finding that contradicts the obvious design.**
Neither source you would reach for first works:

* the window-list dictionary carries **no bundle-id key at all** (verified: the
  dict is exactly ``{Alpha, Bounds, IsOnscreen, Layer, MemoryUsage, Name, Number,
  OwnerName, OwnerPID, SharingState, StoreType}``);
* ``AXBundleIdentifier`` on the application element returns
  ``kAXErrorAttributeUnsupported`` (-25205) for **every** app on this macOS —
  Chrome, Slack, Notes, Obsidian, Outlook, System Settings, all of them. It is
  not an Electron quirk and not a permissions artifact.

So the bundle id comes from ``proc_pidpath`` plus the enclosing bundle's
``Info.plist`` — one syscall and one small plist read, measured under 1ms per pid,
verified correct for all eight apps on screen (``com.google.Chrome``,
``com.tinyspeck.slackmacgap``, ``md.obsidian``, ``com.apple.Notes``,
``com.apple.systempreferences``, …). An unbundled binary yields ``""`` and the
process name carries the identity instead; the gate treats a fully unresolved
identity as a DENY, which is the correct posture for a target we cannot name.

      the backstop spans the whole display from the origin, while the Dock STRIP
      (the icons the operator can click) sits at the bottom or a side edge and is
      never anchored at the top-left, so the strip still blocks a click over it.
