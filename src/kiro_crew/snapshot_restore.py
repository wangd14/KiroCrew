"""Restoring into a live data home: the checks a restore refuses on, then the atomic replace.

:func:`kiro_crew.snapshot.restore_main` sequences extraction and the bundle-shape
refusals, and writes their ``state_restore_rejected`` audits. This module supplies the
bundle predicates those refusals rest on (:func:`_component_payload_absent`,
:func:`_components_absent_from_bundle`, :func:`_trees_absent_from_bundle`), the
content-soundness refusal (:func:`_refuse_corrupt_source_databases`), the destination
guards, and the replace transaction with its rollback. The helpers and limits a test
replaces on :mod:`kiro_crew.snapshot` are read through it when used
(:func:`kiro_crew.snapshot_components._facade`), so a patch there reaches the calls here.

Each refusal runs before live state moves, because that is where declining still costs
nothing. Replace takes a complete rollback set first and mutates second, so a failure in
the mutation phase is reverted target by target from a set known to be whole
(:func:`_do_replace`). Merge mode reuses the destination guards and the locked-document
installer from here; its algorithms live in :mod:`kiro_crew.snapshot_merge`.

    """Raise unless *src* parses as a JSON object.

    A database is not the only thing a restore can install broken. The consumers of these
    files treat an unreadable one as an EMPTY one — `crons.json`'s loader falls back to
    "no jobs" on both a parse error and a well-formed array — so installing a corrupt file
    silently discards the operator's content while the restore reports success. Silent
    emptiness is the worst failure available here: nothing raises, so nothing is retried.

    *installed* is what separates the two hazards, because only one of them is silent.
    Replace INSTALLS this file, so an unparseable one reaches the consumer and reads as
    empty — refusing is the only way the operator hears about it. Merge USUALLY does not
    install it: when a live copy exists, the per-component merger reads the bundle's copy,
    reports a file it cannot parse, and returns without writing live state, so the content
    is neither lost nor lost quietly. Refusing there would turn one unreadable component
    into a failed restore of every other one, which is the opposite of what an off-host
    backup is for.

    "Usually" is load-bearing, not "never". Merge's per-component branch merges only
    `if dst.is_file()`; its sibling `else` copies the bundle's file in VERBATIM. So an
    absent destination -- the fresh-machine case, which is the scenario a backup exists
    for -- does install, and is the one path that could skip this check. The caller
    therefore decides *installed* from "will this reach a consumer", not from "is this a
    replace". Reproduced before the fix: a well-formed JSON array, no live `crons.json`,
    merge copied it verbatim and reported success, and the cron loader then read zero jobs.

    Only structure is checked, not schema. Parsing proves the file survived transport and
    is the shape its consumer branches on; asserting field-level schema here would
    duplicate each consumer's own validation and refuse bundles those consumers accept.

    The shape checks below are gated on *installed* too, matching the parse branch,
    because the merger itself now guards the merge path: `_merge_crons` runs
    `_usable_cron_shape` over BOTH sides and returns without writing when either is
    misshapen, and that guard is a superset of this one -- it also rejects a non-string
    job name and a lone surrogate inside one.

    The recovery half of replace-mode atomicity. Undoing the whole saved set returns the
    data home to one coherent generation regardless of how far the pass got. Recovering
    only the item that failed is what leaves memory half-old and half-new.

    **Granularity is the invariant, and it is exactly *targets*.** Every entry is a
    declared relative path, and recovery touches nothing else. Walking the rollback
    DIRECTORY instead looks equivalent and is not: memory's trees are nested
    (``workspace/memory``), so ``backup`` contains a partial ``workspace/`` holding only
    those subtrees. Treating that directory as one unit clears the live ``workspace``
    whole and puts the partial copy back — deleting unrelated workspace data the restore
    never touched. Restoring `workspace/memory` restores `workspace/memory`.

    Three cases per target, and the third is why *installed* exists:

    * **Saved** — put it back, clearing only that path.
    * **Not saved, and this run installed it** — it did not exist before, so the copy the
      restore created is REMOVED. That is what "no pre-restore state" restores to.
    * **Not saved, and this run never reached it** — LEFT ALONE. Absence of a saved copy
      does not mean absence of prior state: a file is saved by MOVING it aside at the
      moment of its own mutation, so a failure partway through the phase leaves every
      later target untouched and unsaved. Removing those deletes the operator's own data
      that this restore never so much as opened, which is the opposite of recovery.

    Best-effort per target, and it says so per target: a recovery that aborts on its
    first problem strands the rest, and by this point the operator's own data is what is
