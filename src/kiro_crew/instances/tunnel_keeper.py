"""Keep one SSH port-forward alive for the desktop app's client-only mode.

In client-only mode the desktop app runs no local gateway: it loads a remote
crew through a local port that an SSH forward carries to the crew's machine.
The forward dies whenever the laptop sleeps, and nothing in the app rebuilt it,
so every wake ended at the "no gateway is answering" dialog.

Remote Crew already supervises exactly this kind of forward inside the gateway.
This module runs that same supervisor -- :class:`_SshTunnel`, with its readiness
wait, zombie probe and exit classification -- and the same backoff, without a
gateway around it. The instance registry, token minting and hop leases the
manager layers on top are deliberately absent: the desktop app fetches its own
token over SSH, and the forward it needs is a single fixed port pair.

Exits 0 when asked to stop (SIGTERM, SIGINT, or EOF on stdin when the parent
holds it open as a lifeline), and 2 when the arguments are refused.
