"""Skills loader — markdown skill files for agent capabilities.

``SkillsLoader`` is the composition root. It owns the loader's state and locks and
delegates most of its rules to the owners in :mod:`kiro_crew.skill_runtime`. What
stays in this file is what repository guards pin to it by path: the
enumerated-read choke point and its readers, the ``repo_scope`` gate sites,
trigger scoring, every redactor call site (the pending-review sink and the
consent-picker catalog), the skill-tree walk, and the packaged-skill sync with its
provenance and currency checks. Trust enforcement stays beside the choke point it
feeds. Every name that moved is still importable from here. The owners read this
module's constants, and every name it imports from another ``kiro_crew`` module,
through it at call time, so a patch of one of those here still reaches the moved
code. A helper that moved is patched on its owner module instead; sibling owners
call it as an attribute of that module, so the patch reaches every caller.

    """Judge each installed skill against the packaged tree the sync would pick.

    The question this answers is currency: does the install still correspond to
    the package this process is running. A script can report its own identity
    but not its own currency, because currency is a relation between the
    install and the package, and only one side of it is visible from inside a
    shipped file. Both sides are visible here.

    No new provenance data is needed, because the marker already holds the
    answer. ``_ensure_builtin_skills`` records the fingerprint of the PACKAGED
    tree (not of the copy it wrote), and ``_tree_entries`` hashes relative
    paths, modes, link targets and file bytes while excluding mtime entirely.
    The recorded value is therefore a portable content identity of the package
    the install came from, and comparing it against a fresh fingerprint of the
    packaged tree needs no version constant inside any shipped file, no marker
    format change, and no network call.

    What makes staleness silent today is the update gate, not the marker: it
    compares mtimes, so an installed copy carrying an mtime newer than anything
    the package ships is judged up to date, no copy happens, and nothing says
    so. This function reads the same two trees the gate reads and reports the
    comparison the gate throws away.

    ``SKILL_INSTALL_BEHIND`` states that the two sides disagree, not which is
    older: a content hash cannot order two revisions, exactly as
    :func:`deployed_cron_script_sources` reports divergence without a
    direction. "Behind" names the actionable direction in practice because the
    packaged side is the code this process is running.

    ``SKILL_INSTALL_EDITED`` takes precedence over a currency verdict when both
    apply. The marker still identifies the package an edited install came from,
    but the edit is the fact that has to be reconciled first: while it stands,
    the sync quarantines the directory rather than updating it, so reporting
    the install merely as behind would name a remedy that does not apply.

    Source roots are consulted in the sync's own order, project skills before
    packaged ones, and the first root to ship a name owns it. Comparing a
    project skill against a packaged tree of the same name would otherwise
    report every shadowing skill as behind the builtin it deliberately
    replaces.

    An installed directory that NO source root ships is ABSENT from the result
    rather than reported: with no packaged tree there is nothing to be out of
    step with, and a skill the operator installed themselves must not be
    described as stale. Likewise a name that is packaged but not installed --
    the sync installs it on the next run, and an absent directory has no
    currency to judge.

    Every read failure yields ``SKILL_INSTALL_UNVERIFIABLE`` rather than a
    comparison: an unmarked install (pre-provenance, or user-authored by
    assumption), a destination that is itself a link or junction, a skills
    directory that is itself linked, a linked directory between the skills
    directory and a nested install, and a tree over the fingerprint ceilings
    all land there. Unverifiable never reads as agreement, because an
    instrument whose read failed must not report the two sides equal.

    POSIX only, and that gate is the first thing here rather than a detail.
    Every read below reaches its target by name, and the link test guarding each
    one is a separate syscall from the read it guards, so a concurrent writer to
    the skills directory can substitute a link in between. On POSIX the cost of
    losing that race is a wrong verdict. On Windows a junction whose target is a
    UNC share turns the next local-looking stat into an outbound connection that
    authenticates as this process, which nothing afterwards can take back, and
    the descriptor-pinned walk that would close it is unavailable there:
    :func:`kiro_crew.pinned_fs.supports_pinned_walk` requires ``O_NOFOLLOW`` and
    ``os.open`` in ``os.supports_dir_fd``, and Windows offers neither. So this
    reports nothing on Windows rather than reading unsafely, and the doctor
    section says the check does not run instead of printing verdicts it cannot
    stand behind. Tracked separately, with the core primitive it needs.

        A skill carrying ``repo_scope: <relpath>`` is only eligible for

        — e.g. ``repo_scope: src/kiro_crew`` restricts a skill to sessions

        check runs before the skill ever reaches the context (destructive

        *project_dir* is the SESSION's active project — the same value the

        started from inside a checkout of the scoped repo admitted the skill

        Fails CLOSED — no project, an unusable one, or any error suppresses the

        The rule itself lives in ``kiro_crew.project_scope`` because lessons are

        when it does not fit the budget, which the caller turns into a refusal of the
        whole candidate. Relative filenames carry the platform separator, because they
        are served through the API.

        Every bound here is the verdict walk's bound, deliberately: the SAME
        ``_PENDING_SCRIPT_MAX_ENTRIES`` entries and the same ``MAX_SCRIPT_BYTES`` per
        file. Those two ARE the bound on what this accumulates -- at most
        ``entries * per-file`` bytes -- so there is deliberately no third, aggregate
        check: with both of the above in force it could never fire, and a guard that
        cannot fire reads as protection while providing none. This runs per request
        against a tree an agent writes directly, so reusing the verdict's numbers is
        also what keeps the two from disagreeing about which candidates are readable.
        *budget* is threaded through the recursion rather than recreated per directory,
        or a planted tree of many small directories would each get a fresh allowance and
        the total would be unbounded again. Names are enumerated LAZILY against the
        entry cap for the same reason the verdict walk does it: an eager
        ``sorted(names())`` spends the allocation before any budget can refuse it.

        Depth is bounded by ``_PENDING_SCRIPT_MAX_DEPTH``, the same cap the verdict
        walk uses, and bounded the SAME WAY: that walk refuses to descend when the
        directory it is standing in is already at the cap, so it enumerates the level
        AT the cap. The comparison here is ``>`` rather than ``>=`` for exactly that
        reason -- one level tighter would refuse a tree the verdict judged fine, and
        the detail read would answer 404 for a candidate that is waiting for review. The tree is written directly by an agent, so a nesting chain deep
        enough to exhaust the interpreter's recursion limit is free to produce, and
        the resulting ``RecursionError`` would surface as a failed request rather
        than a refused candidate. Refusing at the cap also keeps the two traversals
        in step: a tree the verdict declines to judge is not one this still reads.

        symlinked ``SKILL.md`` or a stray top-level file fails the verdict
        here exactly as approve would refuse it.

        The candidate root is resolved EXACTLY ONCE: one
        :func:`pinned_fs.open_dir_pinned` call pins it (``O_NOFOLLOW`` on the
        root and every ancestor), and that descriptor is retained for the
        whole verdict — the top-level layout scan reads through it, and the
        ``scripts`` directory is opened RELATIVE to it (``dir_fd``), with an
        identity check that the opened directory is the same inode the
        layout scan stat-ed. No name under the candidate is ever re-resolved
        from a path, so a candidate root swapped between any two steps —
        whether for a symlink (refused at the pinned open) or for a
        different REAL directory renamed over it (unreachable, because no
        second resolution exists to land on it) — cannot redirect any part
        of the verdict into another tree. Every entry below ``scripts`` is
        likewise stat-ed, opened and read relative to the walk's own
        descriptors.

        The verdict fails CLOSED on everything the approve path would refuse:
        a symlink entry is an invalid layout, an oversized script is flagged
        from its size alone (its bytes are never loaded — this runs on every
        dashboard poll, and a crystallize direct-write can plant files the
        staging cap never saw), an unreadable or undecodable script is a
        finding rather than a silent omission (approve refuses such a
        candidate at redaction, so ``ok: true`` would be a false all-clear),
        and an unexpected walk error degrades to a failing
        verdict-unavailable finding rather than blanking the caller's whole
        list. Small, decodable scripts get the real ``validate_scripts`` run,
        matching the approve path's verdict.

        Returns ``None`` on a platform without descriptor-relative opens,
        BEFORE the candidate is touched at all. A link/junction check
        followed by a by-name scan races with replacement of the candidate
        root: even a refusal can expose the target's filenames. On Windows
        the pre-click "fails validation" badge disappears entirely, because
        no trustworthy verdict can be computed without descriptor-relative
        opens. The caller omits the field; approve remains the authority at
