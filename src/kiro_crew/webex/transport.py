"""Layer 1 -- Webex Messaging as a concrete ``MessagingTransport``.

Wraps the low-level :class:`WebexClient` (device-WebSocket inbound + REST
outbound) in the channel-neutral transport contract, so the Webex channel
rides the shared ``TurnDriver`` (credential/exfil redaction + tool-approval
ladder + SEL audit) instead of a hand-rolled turn loop.

Dependency direction is ``webex -> messaging`` (allowed); the neutral
``messaging`` package never imports ``webex``.

Webex differs from Slack/Telegram in two ways, both absorbed INSIDE this
transport / its renderer (the neutral layers are untouched):

* No streaming: Webex caps a message at 10 edits, so a typewriter
  edit-stream is infeasible. The renderer posts a placeholder, spends a
  small edit budget on tool-progress status, and delivers the final answer
  in one shot (``streaming=False``, ``edit=True``).
* Group spaces are opt-in and named, fail closed: in a space the bot only sees
  @mentions, but a reply lands in the space -- exposing tool output to every
  member, including people the email allow-list excludes. So a space is answered
  only when the operator enabled group rooms AND named that room; every other
  room type is denied and audited. A direct room needs neither.

        Webex has two audiences, so this dispatches on the route rather than
        testing one id against the wrong set -- the same shape Discord's two
        rosters take.

        A **space** route is recognised by its conversation id being in
        ``_allowed_rooms`` with ``_allow_group_rooms`` still on, which is exactly
        the pair :meth:`room_permitted` gates inbound on, so outbound stays as
        tight as inbound and no tighter. It has to be checked here because a space
        has no principal to check: its route is keyed ``(chat_id, thread_id)``
        under the ``forum`` namespace, and ``chat_runner._session_principal`` names
        a peer only for a 1:1 ``direct`` key. Refusing for want of a principal
        would therefore drop EVERY proactive send into an allow-listed space --
        the dashboard mirror, cron results, subagent completions, compaction
        notices -- while the in-channel turn path kept answering, so the space
        would look half-alive rather than misconfigured. That is the failure the
        base contract calls out: an empty principal means "the key names no one
        person", not "no one is authorized". Matched case-sensitively, because a
        Webex room id is an opaque blob and :meth:`room_permitted` compares it
        exactly. Turning the group switch off, or dropping a room from the list,
        revokes that space's proactive traffic from the next start: a persisted
        link outlives the config that authorized it, and this re-decides against
        the config THIS PROCESS was built with rather than trusting the link. Both
        sets are frozen in ``__init__`` and the config PATCH reports
        ``restart_required`` for them, so a narrowing takes effect on restart --
        which is also why this can never be looser than inbound, since
        :meth:`room_permitted` reads the very same frozen sets.

        A **direct** route has no such roster: the session binds
        ``inbound.room_id`` (see :meth:`receive`) while the email allow-list holds
        **emails**, and a room id is opaque -- nothing in this process maps one
        back to the person in it. *principal* is that person, so the check reaches
        the same allow-list :meth:`authorize` uses, lowercased the same way, and
        with no principal there is nothing left to consult, so it refuses: an
        unidentifiable recipient must not be posted to from a network egress
        boundary.

        That refusal still catches a ``unified`` DM bucket, which collapses several
        peers into one session on purpose, so nothing available here establishes
        which of them the room currently belongs to -- its conversation is a 1:1 DM
        room, which no operator puts in the SPACE allow-list, so it cannot reach
        the arm above. Sessions under the default ``per-channel-peer`` scope carry

        reports no ``roomType`` on the wire, so the client resolves it before
        dispatch (``_room_type_of``) rather than letting this gate special-case
        it: a second branch here would have to guess, and a guess that admits a
        press by room id alone drops every DM press the moment a space is named
        while admitting a space press the group switch never enabled.
