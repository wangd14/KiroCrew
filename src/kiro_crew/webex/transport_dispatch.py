"""Full new-path dispatch: WebexTransport -> TurnDriver -> WebexRenderer.

``WebexTransport.receive()`` authorizes + normalizes an inbound message and
hands the ``WebexInbound`` (carrying ``room_id``) to
:meth:`WebexDispatcher.handle_message`, which mirrors the Telegram/WeCom
transport dispatch:

    card-press intercept (an Adaptive Card submit carries no text)
    -> @mention strip (a space delivers the bot's own name in the text)
    -> approval-reply intercept (while a turn holds the session)
    -> command intercept (/new, /compact, /help, /stop, /link, …)
    -> mid-turn queue or steer
    -> construct WebexRenderer + on_turn_start (immediate placeholder)
    -> drive_turn: session acquire -> origin/mirror bind -> context build
                   -> TurnDriver.run   # shared redaction + approval ladder
                   -> guarded post-turn -> renderer.close() + release
    -> drain whatever queued during the turn

Webex stays ON the shared ``drive_turn`` rather than forking the pipeline the
way Telegram and Discord did. ``drive_turn`` is awaited and releases the session
semaphore in its ``finally``, so by the time the call returns the session is
free and the drain can simply re-enter ``handle_message``. Leaving the shared
pipeline would mean re-deriving mute substitution, identity publication, the
PreToolUse gate, the auto-approve hook and four independently guarded post-turn
steps — five chances to get a security-relevant step subtly wrong, for one
feature.

An approval's PRIMARY affordance is a typed ``1``/``2`` reply, with an Adaptive
Card riding alongside it. That order is deliberate and it is not a shortfall:
Webex refuses to edit a message once it carries an attachment, so a resolved
card's buttons stay clickable forever, and the inbound half of a press travels
over the undocumented device websocket. A typed reply is an ordinary inbound
message, needs nothing from the platform, and arrives on the path this dispatcher
already owns — so it is what the prompt asks for and what always works. The card
is guarded by a nonce minted against the pending decision, which is why a press
on a retired card is inert instead of answering whatever prompt is open now.
Either affordance answers only under INTERACTIVE: ``ChannelTurn.auto_approve_session``
still carries the process-global safety-override grant, so an operator's YOLO — and
``auto``/``trust`` — approves without ever posting a prompt.

The security ``tool_gate`` and the ``spawn_run`` auto-approve are wired
by the shared pipeline off ``ctx_builder.hooks`` (channel-neutral) so this
module never imports ``kiro_crew.slack``.

Dependency direction is ``webex -> messaging`` (allowed).
