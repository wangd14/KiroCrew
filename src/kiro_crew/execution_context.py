    gate has authenticated it (the HTTP gate's ``X-Session-Key``), and this
    function re-vouches ONLY when that key is a member DM key -- ``member-<slug>``,
    whose ``<slug>`` IS the member id, derived from the key itself and NOT from the
    record -- AND the store the vouch would grant is the one CONFIG says that
    member owns. Two shape checks the record alone cannot be trusted on: its
    ``member_id`` must equal the key's slug, and its ``store.store_id`` must equal
    the store ``resolve_member_execution`` derives for that slug from config. The
    second is load-bearing: ``MemoryStoreRef`` shape-checks the store NAME only and
    ``ExecutionContext`` requires just ``store.member_id == member_id``, so a member
    may leave both member-id fields as its own slug while pointing
    ``store.store_id`` at a PEER's store -- and only the config comparison catches
    that. A session whose key is NOT a member DM key takes the durable-record
    branch instead (:func:`_revouch_from_durable_record`): it is re-vouched only
    from a copy of its own earlier vouch that no session can write, so a forger's
    ordinary ``chat-`` slot with no such copy gets nothing.

    ``config`` is a ``KiroCrewConfig`` the caller has already loaded OFF the event
    loop and threads in, so this helper performs no blocking config read of its
    own; the caller runs it off the loop too, since the store resolution it does
    is filesystem-backed.

    Returns True when a vouch was (re-)established, False otherwise. Idempotent:
    an entry the record already agrees with is refreshed rather than duplicated.
    Callable only where the key is genuinely gate-verified; every other reader of
    the vouched map stays read-only.

    store their identity but never touches session records, so without this every
    such chat is refused at the read above. This is the missing half of that
    backfill, done once at first read: the derived carrier is written into the
    record, and every later read decodes it like any other session.

    Nothing here guesses a member. The derivation is admitted only when the
    attribution is unambiguous and mirrors what the store migration itself
    required: the store is a declared V2 store whose ``owner_member_id`` names
    exactly one configured member (`member_config_for_id`), that member resolves

    names that member by alias or by id. The record's own ``app`` attribution is
    carried into the carrier. A record with no ``agent``, an ``agent`` naming
    anyone else, a template pick, a store the migration could not attribute, a
    restricted mode or a malformed ``app`` is left untouched and the caller keeps
