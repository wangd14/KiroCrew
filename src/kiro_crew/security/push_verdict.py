"""Gateway-owned push verdicts: evidence the push guard ran, held where the agent cannot reach it.

WHAT THIS IS
------------
The prepare-pr skill's pre-push stale-base guard answers one question -- is this branch
being published on a base that has moved -- and a verdict that is only printed persists
nothing, so a publish whose gate was skipped is byte-identical to one whose gate passed.

The evidence lives HERE, in the gateway process, and nothing outside this process writes
it. The agent asks the gateway to run the guard; the gateway runs it, records what IT
observed, and the ``git push`` allow path in the shell-command floor reads that record.

WHY THE GATEWAY IS THE WRITER
-----------------------------
Any store the agent can write is evidence the gated party controls, and signing does not
help when the key is as readable as the file. So the writer is the one party the agent
cannot impersonate: the gateway itself. ``record`` is called from the gateway's own route
handler, which runs in this process; the MCP tool the agent calls is a separate process
that reaches that route over loopback and carries a request, never a result.

WHY THE GATE TOUCHES NO FILESYSTEM
----------------------------------
The publish floor runs inside the permission gate, where a slow mount is a stall of every
task in the process. So the floor reads THIS module's in-process mapping and nothing else:
no receipt file, no policy file, no ref read, no subprocess, no network.

That is affordable because the gateway already sees every command it authorizes. It does
not need to re-read ``HEAD`` to know the tree moved -- it can watch for the commands that
move it. ``invalidate_on`` is called for every authorized command, drops the session's
verdict when that command can change ``HEAD`` or the base, and ``mutates_head`` is the same
predicate the floor uses to refuse a publish that carries a mutation in its own command
line. A compound ``git commit --amend && git push`` is therefore refused rather than judged
on the pre-amend state, which a pre-execution gate could never judge correctly.

WHAT A VERDICT IS KEYED ON
--------------------------
The CALLING SESSION, never a worktree named in a request body -- the contract
``dashboard/handlers/session_ledger.py`` states for its own routes. A session cannot ask
for a verdict about one worktree and then publish from another, because it never names the
worktree: its own identity selects the record. There is no enrolled list, so there is also
no over-refusal of a repository nobody asked about.

ACTIVATION IS THE OPERATOR'S, AND IT IS TRUSTED
-----------------------------------------------
``activation_enabled`` reads a leaf on the protected keystone -- the one placement where the
agent's file tools can neither read nor write it (it is write-protected and file-tool
unreadable; the read-only sandbox mount still lets a shell read the bytes), the same floor the
computer-use primary enable sits on
and for the same reason. ``config.json`` may REQUEST activation; only the keystone
AUTHORIZES it, so an agent with file-write access cannot enable or disable this gate. It is
off until an operator turns it on out of band, so an installation that never activates it
is judged exactly as it is on main.

Once activated, the check runs in the UNCONDITIONAL git-publish path rather than behind the
opt-out tiers, because an opt-out key would hand the gated party its own bypass.

Activation is on disk and survives a restart. Verdicts are the opposite, in-process only: a
restart costs one guard re-run rather than leaving a stale pass behind.

A git ``pre-push`` hook is deliberately NOT the mechanism: the gateway pins
``core.hooksPath=/dev/null`` so a repository-planted hook cannot execute host-side.

#: publish segment is judged on its own subcommand rather than on the whole line's words.
#: Command substitution opens a segment too, so a git nested inside one is still seen.
#:
#: This is ``shell_normalizer``'s splitter rather than one of our own. A local copy lived here
#: and was a THIRD spelling of the same grammar -- and the narrower one: it missed the lone
#: background ``&``, so ``git push & git reset --hard`` read as a single segment and the
#: mutation in it went unseen. Reusing the sibling both removes the duplicate and closes that

#: on a command that changed nothing.
#:
#: Deliberately limited to the SUBVERB position. An option-level dry run -- ``git apply
