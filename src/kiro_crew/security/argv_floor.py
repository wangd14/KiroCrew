"""The argv-structural self-protection floor: a floor that reads argv, not text.

Always on, and deliberately not a regex tier. Every predicate here answers a
question about a command's STRUCTURE -- which token is the program, which token
is a subcommand, which token is a redirection target, which payload a nested
interpreter would actually run -- so the product's own name appearing somewhere
in a path, a search pattern or a commit message is not on its own an answer.
That distinction is the whole reason the floor exists beside the catalog: the
catalog matches text and can be pinned or opted out of, while these predicates
are the last word on the handful of actions that must never succeed no matter
what the settings say.

Three families live here:

* Release detection, which recognises a publish invocation by its subcommand
  position rather than by the verb appearing anywhere, then decides whether the
  refspec it carries names a protected branch. It fails CLOSED: an invocation
  whose target cannot be read cleanly is refused rather than guessed at.
* Termination, restart, update and destructive-cloud subcommand floors, which
  recognise the product as the argv's own program and the action as its own
  subcommand.
* The credential-mint predicates, which follow a payload through the carriers
  that can hand it to an interpreter -- an inline program, a here-document, a
  standard-input redirection, a nested shell -- and ask whether the product's
  package is imported in it.

Writes INTO the governance data home are not a floor here: the OS sandbox mounts
the keystone read-only in every mode, so an archive or copy destination flag
aimed at it is refused by the kernel rather than by a matcher over the command's
text.

Layer. This module sits above the shell reader and reads its word layer, the
shared name vocabulary below it, and one sentinel the rule catalog owns for a
floor denial that no catalog pattern matches. It imports nothing from the facade,
so the dependency runs one way.

The audit emitter for an allowed feature-branch push is NOT here. It belongs to
the tier that decides to allow, which is the evaluator, and it redacts the
command it records through the output-redaction side; keeping it beside the
evaluator is what keeps this module free of that edge.

# ── Git publish detection (verb-anchored) ──
# ``git push`` must be blocked, but ``push`` appearing anywhere in arbitrary
# command text (a commit message, a branch name, a grep pattern, an ssh remote
# payload) must NOT trip the deny.  We therefore require ``push`` to be the git
# *subcommand* — i.e. the first non-flag/non-option token after ``git`` — rather
# than a substring.  Mirrors the anchored regex in
# ``config/defaults.json`` deniedCommands.
#
# ``git [<-c k=v>...] [<-C path>...] push ...`` is a publish.  Intervening
# tokens may only be options (``-x``) or option-with-value pairs
# (``-C /path``, ``-c core.x=y``) — a bare non-flag token before ``push``
# (e.g. ``stash``) means ``push`` is NOT the subcommand, so ``git stash push``
# is correctly allowed.  Anchored to a segment start (optionally preceded by a
# command separator) so ``git log --grep push`` is not matched.
#
# The trailing terminator is a lookahead that accepts whitespace, end-of-string,
# OR a shell metacharacter that closes/terminates the segment — so a bare
# ``git push`` (no remote/branch, valid: pushes current branch to the default
# remote) is still caught inside ``$(git push)``, `` `git push` ``, ``git push|cat``,
# ``git push&``, etc., not just when followed by a space.

    # an ambiguity that backtracks exponentially (ReDoS) on whitespace-laden
    # flag runs when the trailing ``push`` is absent.

    command-position regex (which matches ``kiro[-.]?crew``, not the underscored import

    authenticates every gateway route, including the ops autonomy-ceiling PUT, so the
    bypass let a prompt-injected agent raise its own security ceiling.

    Matched structurally, like the rest of the floor: an interpreter, then ``-m``
    (possibly after other interpreter flags), then the module. ``-m`` must be a separate
    token — ``python -mkiro_crew`` is also valid, so that spelling is checked too.

    ``-c`` is the SAME escape one flag over, and is matched here for that reason:
    ``python -c "from kiro_crew.cli import main; main()" token`` reaches the identical mint
    with the import name buried in an inline-program payload. The two forms differ only in
    how the interpreter is told to import the package, so they cannot be gated separately —
    an "anything that is not a flag means this is not the module shape" bail reads the
    payload as a script name and returns False.

    Interpreter flags that take a SEPARATE OPERAND (``-X dev``, ``-W ignore``, ``-Q new``)
    have their operand skipped. Stopping at the first token that does
    not begin with ``-`` bails on ``dev`` in ``python -X dev -m kiro_crew token`` and lets
    the mint through — the bypass this whole function exists to close, one flag
    deeper. Modelling which flags consume an operand is the fix; "stop at the
    first non-flag" is not expressible as a heuristic here, because an operand and a script

# ── Self-protection floor short-circuit (perf) ──
# The floor predicates below re-tokenize the command and descend every nested
# shell payload (`_self_token_frames`), which is where the cost of the deny
# scan concentrates: it scales with NESTING COMPLEXITY, and each `is_denied`
# call runs the descent three times (mint once, kill twice). The common tool
# call — a tool name plus a path — can never fire either predicate, so the
# descent is pure waste there.
#
# The gate is a NECESSARY condition, deliberately wider than a raw
# `_SELF_NAME_RE` search. That narrower gate is UNSOUND: the
# predicates fire on inputs whose raw text never matches `kiro[-.]?crew` —
# `python -m kiro_crew token` (the underscored import spelling), `[k]irocrew
# token` (one-char bracket class), `kiro$()crew` (empty substitution),
# `kiro${x:-crew}` (parameter default), `bash -c "\x6birocrew token"` (printf
# escapes), `kiro?rew` (glob the shell expands before exec), and a `-c`
# payload reaching the CLI through `exec`/`b64decode` with no name at all.
# Every one of those is denied by the floor, so a gate that skipped them would
# be a real bypass, not an optimization.
#
# Sound formulation: the floor can only fire if, after the normalizations the
# predicates themselves apply (shlex quote-stripping, `_debracket`,
# `_resolve_param_defaults`, `_EMPTY_SUBST_RE`, `_decode_printf_escapes`,
# `_glob_could_expand_to`), the text yields a self name/module — or an inline
# dynamic-exec primitive stands in for it. Each normalization needs specific
# MACHINERY characters present in the raw text, so the union below is a
# superset of every firing path:
#   * the literal name in any spelling (`kiro[-._]?crew` — underscore included
#     for the module/import form, which `_SELF_NAME_RE` deliberately omits);
#   * any machinery character that lets a normalization synthesize the name or
#     a program spelling: glob/brace chars (`? * [ ] { }` — `_glob_could_expand_to`
#     admits e.g. `k*w` for the program AND `*kill` for the kill verbs),
#     `$` (substitutions, parameter defaults, ANSI-C quoting), backticks, and
#     `~` (tilde expansion — the kill predicates expanduser their targets, so
#     `pkill -f ~` IS a self-kill whenever $HOME lies under the product tree,
#     with no name and no other machinery in the raw text);
#   * printf numeric escapes (`\xHH`, `\NNN`) that can spell arbitrary
#     characters once `_decode_printf_escapes` runs on a nested payload;
#   * the dynamic-exec markers `_inline_payload_reaches_cli` accepts in place
#     of a literal import — checked on the raw text AND on the quote-stripped
#     text, because empty-quote glue hides the verb exactly as it hides the
#     name (`python -c "ex""ec(...)"` carries no name and no other machinery,
#     yet the floor denies it);
#   * the literal name once quotes, backslashes and a `\`+newline continuation
#     come off (`k""iro""crew`, `ki\rocrew`, `kiro\`+nl+`_crew` — shlex folds them).
# When none of these is present, no predicate can return True, so the descent
# is skipped. False positives (e.g. any `$VAR` in a command) merely fall back
# to the full scan — the safe direction.

    """Substitution bodies inside a bare ``kill``'s own argv, read from the RAW text.

    The token walk in :func:`_is_self_kill` bounds the same window with
    :class:`_SubstitutionDepth`, which counts parens on tokens
    ``normalize_shell_command`` has already stripped the quotes from -- so by the
    time the counter runs, a QUOTED close-paren is indistinguishable from a real
    closer and it ends the window early: ``kill $(printf ')' ; pgrep -f
    kirocrew)`` scored the quoted paren as depth -1, cut the argv at the ``;``,
    and dropped the ``pgrep`` clause that names the target -- while bash, whose
    substitution scan is quote-aware, runs that ``pgrep`` (measured).

    The raw text still HAS the quotes, so the window is re-derived here from the
    same quote-aware machinery the extractor uses (:func:`_iter_shell_chars`
    for the walk, :func:`_matching_close_paren` for each span): a separator
    splits a segment only OUTSIDE quotes and OUTSIDE any substitution span, and
    a body is attributed only when it sits AFTER a top-level word that resolves
    to ``kill`` in the SAME segment.  Both bounds carry weight: the segment
    bound keeps ``kill 123; echo $(cat /tmp/kirocrew)`` allowed (the
    substitution belongs to the ``echo``), and the forward bound keeps
    ``LOG=$(ls /tmp/kirocrew.log) kill 4242`` allowed (the substitution
    precedes the kill, so it is an environment word's value, not the kill's
    operand) -- the exact false positive the token walk's own scoping replaced.

    Three quoting rules are load-bearing, each bash-measured (pre-push review):

    * A substitution body is parsed in its OWN NEUTRAL quote context, because
      that is how bash reads ``$( )`` -- a ``$(`` inside double quotes closes at
      an interior ``)`` even though the outer quote is still open.  The walk
      then RESUMES with the outer quote state it carried into the opener, so
      ``echo "$(date)" ; kill $(...)`` keeps its ``;`` as a real separator and
      the kill segment is still scanned.
    * A backtick closer is found through an escape-skipping scan: within
      backticks a backslash escapes ``\\``` and the escaped backtick is DATA,
      so taking it as the closer would truncate the body before the clause
      that names the target.
    * ``&>`` / ``&>>`` (and the trailing ``2>&1`` form) are redirects of the
      SAME simple command, not separators -- splitting there discarded the
      ``kill`` word before its substitution was attributed.

    A word GLUED to a substitution (``kill$(x)``, ``LOG=$(x)``) is never the
    bare ``kill`` this scan attributes to: bash joins the expansion into the
    word, so the program it runs is not the literal word prefix.  Glued words
    are flagged and excluded from the kill match, which keeps
    ``echo kill$(printf kirocrew)`` -- where ``kill...`` is an argument of
    ``echo`` -- out of the deny set.

    Words collect what the shell PASSES, not what the operator typed: a quote
    character that is quote SYNTAX (an opener or closer -- the state machine's
    own transitions say which) is dropped, while a quote character that is DATA
    (inside the other quote type, or escaped) is kept.  Without that,
    ``k''ill`` reaches the comparison spelled with its splice and the kill is
    missed (bash-measured: the spliced spelling runs
    ``kill``).  A syntax quote still OPENS a word -- ``''#`` is the word ``#``,
    not a comment -- which the ``open_word`` flag carries.

    An UNPROVEN span (parens that never balance) takes the whole remainder as
    the body and ends the walk.  That cannot under-detect: bash cannot execute
    past an unterminated substitution either (the whole line is a syntax
    error), so there is no later command to lose -- while the remainder still
    reaches the name search attributed to the CURRENT segment, which is what
    keeps the decoyed-and-unbalanced spelling detected.

    A top-level ``#`` starting a word begins a comment, which ends at the next
    newline; the skip lands ON that newline so the segment boundary it carries
    is still honoured.

    This pass is a UNION with the token walk, never a replacement: the tokens
    carry resolutions the raw text does not (``p=$(pgrep -f kirocrew); kill $p``
    resolves ``$p`` at tokenization) and the raw text carries the quoting the
    tokens lost.  Keeping both is what guarantees no spelling either half
    detects is dropped.

# ── Sandbox-escape floor (ssh back into this same host) ──
# The agent's shell runs inside a sandbox; sshd does not.  A connection whose
# TARGET is this same machine re-enters it outside every control in this
# module, so the floor resolves the target in OPERAND POSITION — behind
# options (``ssh -p 22 localhost``), redirects, a ``user@`` prefix, URI
# schemes, bracketed/bare IPv6 and numeric IPv4 literals, and quoting the
# raw-text regex cannot see through — and refuses it when it names this host.
#
# Named residuals, fail-open BY DESIGN (failing closed on any of these would
# deny every legitimate remote ssh, which this box's workflows depend on):
# config-level routing that needs ssh's own config resolution (``-F`` files,
# ssh_config Host aliases), and a substitution that only resolves to this
# host at run time (``$(some-command)``).  The literal
# ``hostname``-substitution spellings and ``-o hostname=``/``-o proxyjump=``
# values ARE checked below, as text, and a ``-o proxycommand=`` value is
# checked twice (round-26): the floor recurses on it as a command line AND
# scans it for a LITERAL self endpoint (``nc 127.0.0.1 22`` relays the
# session to the local sshd with no ssh verb for the recursion to see) --
# a resolvable ALIAS inside such a transport stays in the residual class.
# The alias fail-open above is scoped: a DOTLESS alias is answered from the
# hosts file same-call (open) with async revalidation; a DOTTED alias that
# resolves is classified by its addresses; a DOTTED name whose lookup FAILS
# is refused per call, deliberately -- answering a failed lookup open would
# let whoever controls resolution mint an allow by suppressing it, the
# same class the verdict cache refuses to latch.
#
# The strictly larger residual is OUT OF GATE SCOPE by the module's own
# doctrine (a script body is never a gate subject): interpreter/script-file
# indirection (``bash escape.sh``, ``python -c`` + subprocess or paramiko)
# and non-ssh-family clients (``git clone ssh://localhost/…``, autossh) reach
# the unsandboxed sshd without an ssh-family command line ever crossing this
# floor.  The sandbox has no network namespace, so loopback:22 stays
# reachable from inside; this floor is the interim tier, and the fix of
# record is an OS-level network fence in the sandbox (tracked follow-up:
# see the sandbox-escape residuals note in docs/system-specs/modules/security.md).

    """True if *text_lower* opens an ssh/scp/sftp/rsync channel to THIS host.

    Structural for the same reason the other floors are: the target hides
    behind options, redirects, quoting, and prefixes.  The argv walk is
    FAIL-CLOSED about option grammar: EVERY token that could be an operand —
    including one sitting where an option's value would go — is checked
    against the self-host set.  The per-verb value-taking table
    (``_VERB_VALUE_TAKING_OPT_LETTERS``) never exempts a token from that
    check; it only decides whether the token after an option keeps HOST
    POSITION (the DNS-layer gate) and whether it consumes the ssh/sftp
    positional slot, with collisions resolved toward value-taking — the
    over-checking direction (a valueless-flag table exempting the target
    itself is the shape that mis-consumed ``scp -r localhost:…``).  A
    non-forwarding option value (a port, a cipher) never names this host, so
    the check costs nothing; a self-host hiding in value position is denied.
    The one carved-out value class is the forward/bind specs
    (``_SSH_FORWARD_OPT_LETTERS``): ``ssh -L 127.0.0.1:8080:db:5432
    far-host`` names a local LISTEN address, not a destination, and must
    stay allowed.
    ssh/sftp consume their FIRST unshadowed operand as the positional host
    (later operands are the remote command, where a word like "localhost" is
    data, not a destination); scp/rsync accept a target in any operand
    position.  ``opt=value`` tokens (``-ohostname=localhost``,
    ``-o proxyjump=localhost``) have their value checked too.  Redirections
    are stepped over the way bash removes them from argv.  Same argv-boundary
    discipline as the self-kill floor: the walk is substitution-aware and
    stops at this command's own separator.

    Two evasions are neutralized before the walk.  Empty command substitutions
    (``s$()sh``, ``local$()host``) expand to nothing, so they are collapsed out
    of the source text first -- otherwise they hide the verb from the substring
    gate and the self-host from an operand.  Quote and backslash splices
    (``ss""h``, ``s\\sh``) are rejoined by shlex in the tokens but still hide the
    verb from the raw-substring gate, so the gate probes a splice-stripped copy.
    Two value classes are command lines this host runs LOCALLY rather than
    hosts, and both recurse this floor on the value: ssh's
    ``-o proxycommand=``/``-o localcommand=`` (in
    ``_routing_option_value_targets_self``) and rsync's ``-e``/``--rsh``.
    rsync also honors a leading ``RSYNC_RSH=`` environment assignment as the
    same selector -- handled in the walk below; the wider remote-shell env-var
    family (``GIT_SSH_COMMAND`` and the like) is a documented residual, as are
    the shell-builtin export spellings (``declare -x``/``typeset -x``), which
    are not leading-assignment syntax and so are not modeled by the walk.
