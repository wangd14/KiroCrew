"""Marks the self-protection tokenizer glues onto quoted text before the quotes go.

bash reads a reserved word (``case``, ``esac``, ``in``, the command-position keepers)
only when no character of it is quoted, and a backtick inside single quotes or behind
a backslash is text rather than a command substitution.  The tokenizer drops the
quotes, so the argv walker (``shell_normalizer._SubstitutionDepth``) reading the
de-quoted tokens could not tell ``"case"`` from ``case`` or ``'a`b'`` from ``a`b``:
the first armed a phantom ``case`` pattern and the second opened a substitution no
later token closed, and in both an ssh destination behind the token was never read.

:func:`mask_quoted_reserved_words` runs one quote-state pass over the RAW text and
glues :data:`QUOTED_WORD_MARK` onto a quoted grammar word, and rewrites a single-quoted
or escaped backtick to :data:`QUOTED_TICK_MARK`; the walker then reads an ordinary word,
and every site that compares a token's text drops the marks again.  Both bytes sit
outside the ``\\x00``-``\\x06`` range ``argv_floor._QUOTED_SEP_SENTINELS`` uses for the
same job on the command separators.
