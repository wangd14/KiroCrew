"""The product's own name, as the matchers spell it, plus the by-name kill verbs.

The lowest layer of the package: pure vocabulary, no predicate and no decision.
Two tiers read it and neither owns it. The shell reader resolves a substitution
or an alias back to a program name and has to recognise the product's own name to
know it is looking at the product; the argv-structural self-protection floor
above the reader matches the same name in command position. Holding the spellings
here is what keeps that a one-way dependency instead of the reader depending on
the floor and the floor on the reader.

Imports nothing from the package, so every layer above may load-import it.

Two spellings of the name, because the tiers ask two different questions: one
matches the name ANYWHERE in a token, the other only as a whole program name --
bare or as the tail of a path -- which is what separates an invocation of the
product from a directory that merely carries its name. The comment above
``_is_self_program`` in the shell reader, the sole consumer of the whole-program
form, records that distinction where the matching happens.
