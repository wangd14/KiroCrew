# Triggers a Kiro Agent session owns that the gateway has no lifecycle call site
# for. They are authorable and persisted, and NO EVENT FIRES ANY OF THEM: no call
# site fires one and no other reader consumes this tuple. That is why they are a
# separate tuple rather than new members of ``HOOK_EVENTS`` -- an event in that
# tuple carries a promise that something calls ``fire`` for it, and these carry
# none.
#
# "No event fires them" is not "the command cannot run": the dashboard's Test
# endpoint runs a STORED hook's command on demand and never consults this tuple
# (``handlers/hooks.py`` ``api_hook_test`` -> ``run_script_hook``), so Test works on
# one of these exactly as it does on a fired event.
#
# They are not equidistant from running, and a reader planning the delivery side
# needs the difference. A Kiro Agent requests hooks by trigger name over ACP from
# a fixed set of seven (``acp/kas_wire.py``'s ``ACP_HOOK_TRIGGERS``), and only
# ``preTaskExecution`` and ``postTaskExecution`` are in it; the file and manual
# triggers are absent, so a Kiro Agent does not ask for those four at all today.
#
# Where the six names come from, since no call site here fires them: each is the
# PascalCase rendering of a trigger name Kiro's own hook schema carries, so the
# delivery round maps a documented name rather than inventing one. Kiro documents
# both spellings of each -- the ``when.type`` name a legacy hook file uses, which
# is also the ACP spelling for the two above, and the standalone v1 hook-file
# trigger -- at kiro.dev/docs/ide/whats-new-v1/hooks:
#
#   preTaskExecution  -> PreTaskExec        postTaskExecution -> PostTaskExec
#   fileCreated       -> PostFileCreate     fileEdited        -> PostFileSave
#   fileDeleted       -> PostFileDelete     userTriggered     -> (none)
#
# Two consequences for the delivery round. It has two vocabularies to map, not
# one, and the names here match the left column. And the manual trigger is the
# furthest from arriving of the six: it has no v1 equivalent at all, so an
# existing manual hook stays runnable as a legacy one while a new one cannot be
# authored in that schema -- the Test button is its whole run path here.

    The ``auto_approve_subagent_spawn`` rung must key on canonical,
    NON-model-authored identity: ``event.title`` is LLM-authored prose (for
    shell tools ``select_tool_title`` even prefers the model's description),
    so ANY event whose title is forged to ``spawn_run`` — a shell command, a
    re-titled ``send_file``, anything — must never satisfy this rung.

    Canonical identity only, deny-by-default: ``event.tool_name`` (from
    ``_meta.kiro``, never model-authored) must be ``spawn_run``, carry the
    ``mcp_identity_trusted`` provenance flag (non-emptiness alone is not

    foreign server or a built-in that merely NAMES a tool ``spawn_run``
    cannot ride the rung.

    The title must ALSO read ``spawn_run``. Not as identity — the title is
    forgeable and never sufficient — but because the channel PreToolUse gate
    (``build_tool_gate``) keys deny rules on the title: a genuine spawn whose
    display title was rephrased must fall to the approval ladder rather than
    let this rung approve past a title-keyed deny that would otherwise have
    fired. This exactly preserves the rung's pre-fix approval surface (title
    ``spawn_run``), minus the forgeries.

    There is deliberately NO title fallback: on a backend that does not emit
    ``_meta.kiro`` (or on the correlated provenance-cache miss) the rung
    simply does not fire and the request falls to the channel's normal
    approval ladder (session trust / YOLO / interactive) — a downgrade,

    hand-copies the fields it happens to know about drops the ones it does not
    — the edit gate's ``diff_path``, or the trusted MCP identity a per-tool
    deny / governance ``@server/tool`` rule keys on — and the drop is SILENT:
    the gate never sees that signal on that surface. That is why the threading
    lives here and not at the sites. ``test_hooks.py`` pins the helper's output
    against the gate's own keyword signature (a new gate parameter must be
    extracted here) and scans the package so no site hand-copies a field.

    Reads the event duck-typed (``getattr`` with the gate's own defaults),
    exactly as the channel dispatchers already did: an ``AcpEvent`` yields its
    fields verbatim, a provider event or test double missing a field yields the
    gate default for it, and a ``None`` in a string/bool slot is normalised to
    that default. ``command`` comes from ``AcpEvent.shell_command`` (None for a
    non-shell tool or an unrecoverable command, which the gate then denies by
    default when ``is_shell`` is set); ``mcp_tool_name`` is the event's
    ``tool_name`` (the ``_meta.kiro`` identity, not the model-authored
    ``title``).

    ``overrides`` let a surface with a genuinely different event shape replace
    an extracted value (the auto-improvement runner recovers the command
    provider-agnostically and falls back from ``tool_kind`` to ``tool_purpose``).
    An override key the helper does not emit is refused: a misspelt override
    would otherwise add a stray kwarg the gate rejects — or worse, one a future
    gate accepts with a meaning the site never intended — so the failure is

        """Check if a tool should be auto-approved, denied, or handled normally.

        ``tool_name`` is the display title/pill label. For shell tools it may
        be an LLM-authored ``description`` string rather than the literal
        command (``select_tool_title`` in ``acp/_dispatch.py`` prefers
        ``description`` over ``command``), so it is UNTRUSTED for security
        decisions. When the caller has the raw executable command it MUST pass
        it as ``command=``; every security check then also runs against the
        real command, closing the bypass where a benign title/description hid
        a dangerous command (``auto_deny_tools`` and the sensitive-path /
        credential-read protections both keyed off the title otherwise).
        Over-blocking is the safe direction: a match on EITHER the title or the
        command denies. Auto-approve stays keyed on the title only — failing to
        auto-approve merely falls through to interactive approval.

        The optional keyword-only ``session_key`` / ``agent`` / ``app`` identify
        the calling surface so the governance ceiling ∩ active-profile can be
        resolved and a tool/MCP call denied even when the kiro agent config
        granted it (the governance headline behavior).  They default to ``""`` so
        every existing caller is unaffected; a caller that supplies identity opts
        into per-surface governance.

        ``tool_kind`` (the ACP semantic kind: ``read``/``edit``/``fetch``/…) and
        ``raw_params`` (the real tool arguments — ``path``/``url``) let the gate
        enforce the path/host scopes a display title cannot carry
        (``filesystem.write``, ``network.egress``).  Both default to empty, so a
        caller that does not thread them only loses those two arg-derived scopes,
        never the title-derived ones.  ``raw_params`` additionally feeds the deny
        tiers a synthesized ``file-search …`` target (``_search_deny_target``) for a
        search-shaped call, whose walked root and depth cap exist ONLY in its
        arguments; a caller that omits ``raw_params`` loses that coverage too.

        ``diff_path`` is the path the tool call's ``{"type": "diff"}`` content
        block named (``event.diff_path``, cached by ``acp._dispatch`` per scoped
        toolCallId). A nonempty ``diff_path`` is itself write-plane evidence —
        the cache is written only when a tool_call frame declares a file
        change — so the write-protected tier judges any call carrying one (or
        declaring the ``edit`` kind) by the UNION of the params' path
        spellings and this path, and denies an empty union: a backend may
        stream params that carry no path key and name the file only in that
        block, so the params alone can judge nothing
        (mirroring ``llm_helpers._edit_target_denial``). Defaults to
        ``""``: a caller that does not thread it keeps params-only judgement of
        edits, and an edit-kind call that carries params (any dict, ``{}``
        included) or a diff block but names no path is denied rather than
        passed unjudged. Only ``raw_params=None`` with no ``diff_path`` falls
        through — such an edit has nothing to judge here and keeps the other
        tiers' coverage, exactly like ``_edit_target_denial``, which an edit
        with no params never reaches.

        ``is_shell`` enforces deny-by-default for shell tools: when a caller
        reports a shell tool (``is_shell=True``) but cannot supply the raw
        ``command`` (extraction failed — e.g. malformed params), the title
        alone is not a trustworthy basis for a decision, so the call is DENIED
        rather than silently falling through to the title-only checks. Callers
        that always pass a resolved command can leave ``is_shell`` at its
        default; those forwarding an event should pass both the command and the
        event's ``is_shell`` flag.

        ``mcp_server_name`` is the NON-model-authored MCP server identity from
        the ACP event's ``_meta.kiro.mcpServerName`` (``AcpEvent.mcp_server_name``),
        set by kiro-cli ONLY for MCP-served tool calls and empty for shell /
        built-in tools. It is the trusted discriminator "this call was genuinely
        served by MCP server X" — as opposed to the LLM-authored ``tool_name``
        title, which a prompt-injected agent can forge (e.g. titling a Bash call
        ``mcp__<app>:srv__x``). The app-own-server auto-approve keys on THIS, never
        on the title, so a forged title cannot win an auto-approval. Empty (the
        default, or a backend that omits ``_meta.kiro``) fails closed: no match.

        ``mcp_tool_name`` is the sibling NON-model-authored tool identity from
        ``_meta.kiro.toolName`` (``AcpEvent.tool_name``). Despite the name it is
        NOT MCP-only: kiro-cli sets it for every tool call it serves, built-ins
        included, and sets ``mcp_server_name`` only for MCP-served ones. It is
        therefore evaluated on the deny and governance planes whenever present,
        server or no server -- otherwise a built-in's real name (``fs_write``)
        reaches no check at all and a deny/ceiling rule naming it is bypassable
        behind a benign model-authored title. With both present the
        gate reconstructs the canonical ``mcp__<server>__<tool>`` name and runs
        the effective deny set AND the governance ceiling against it as well as
        against the title — because the ``tool_name`` title above is LLM-authored
        prose (``select_tool_title`` prefers the model's ``description``) and may
        not carry the canonical form a per-tool MCP policy matches on. Without
        this, an ordinary MCP call whose policy-denied tool arrives under a benign
        description would pass the gate and reach the human prompt, where an
        "allow" would run a tool the ceiling forbids.

        The canonical name is ADDED to those checks, never SUBSTITUTED for the
        title: the two carry different security signals. The canonical name is
        the trusted statement of WHICH MCP tool is being invoked, and is what a
        per-tool ceiling or deny rule matches. The title and raw command carry
        the path, command and content signals that a tool identity does not
        express — ``~/.aws/credentials`` read through an innocuously named MCP
        tool is denied by the title, not by the identity. Different dimensions,
        so a deny on EITHER denies the call. Empty (no ``_meta.kiro.toolName``)
        means the tool cannot be identified, so the own-server auto-approve does
        NOT fire (fall through to interactive approval — fail-closed).

        ``classifier_only`` drops the two GRANT tiers — the operator's
        ``auto_approve_tools`` globs and the app-own-server rule — so the only
        auto-approve left is the read-only classifier's, which carries
        ``read_only=True`` on the result. A grant vouches for the caller and
        says nothing about the call's effect; ``ToolApprovalPolicy.READ_ONLY``
        (the side chat) has no approver behind it, so a grant honoured there
        would execute a mutating tool. Every deny tier and governance still
        run, and a call a grant would have approved is classified on its own
        merits instead of being refused outright. Default ``False``: a caller
        with an interactive approver keeps the grants.

        Under the flag the classifier also tightens WHAT counts as proof: with
        no approver to catch an over-approval, read-only must follow from
        HOST-TRUSTED facts alone — the recovered shell ``command`` judged by
        ``is_read_only_bash``, or a built-in the host knows to be read-only,
        named by the non-model-authored ``mcp_tool_name`` with no
        ``mcp_server_name`` (``_HOST_READ_ONLY_BUILTIN_TOOLS``) AND carrying
        ``mcp_identity_trusted``, the provenance flag saying that pair came

        provable either. Off the flag the interactive path keeps its ACP-kind
        allow-list and title fallback unchanged.

      provenance-verified source (``AcpEvent.mcp_identity_trusted``: the

    * ``mcp_tool_name`` non-empty — ``_meta.kiro.toolName``, which kiro-cli
      sets for built-ins too. Empty (a backend that omits ``_meta.kiro``, an
      uncached permission event) identifies nothing and matches nothing.
    * ``mcp_server_name`` empty — kiro-cli stamps ``mcpServerName`` on every

      called ``fs_read`` carries a server name and fails closed here. Only a
      built-in has no server behind it.

    to refuse under a single spelling — ``path="~"`` walks the home tree just as
    ``path="/home/alice"`` does, and a rule anchored on the literal root matches
    only the latter. Mirrors what the sensitive-path keystone on this same gate
    already does with ``raw_params['path']``.

    Steps: expand the home variables and ``~``, ``normpath``, rewrite separators to
    ``/``, and collapse a leading ``//`` to ``/`` on POSIX. The separator rewrite keeps
    the emitted grammar OS-independent: ``normpath`` produces backslash separators on
    Windows, so a rule authored with ``/`` — the form the spec documents — would
    silently stop matching there, which fails OPEN. The collapse is POSIX-only
    because POSIX leaves a path beginning with exactly two slashes
    implementation-defined while on Windows a leading ``//`` is a UNC or
    extended-length root that must survive intact.

    Variable expansion is restricted to ``_SEARCH_HOME_VARS`` (see
    ``_expand_home_vars``) because this value is MODEL-AUTHORED and the resulting
    target is audited: expanding arbitrary variables would dereference a secret into
    a log. A non-home variable therefore stays literal, so no rule keyed on an
    absolute prefix matches it — an over-block/under-match in the same fail-safe
    direction as the relative-root decision below.

    DELIBERATELY NOT ``abspath``, which is where this diverges from
    ``governance._norm_item``: absolutizing resolves a relative root against the
    GATEWAY process cwd, which is not the cwd the tool runs in. That misattribution
    cuts both ways — a rule denying the tree actually walked is bypassed, and a rule
    naming the gateway's own tree falsely denies an unrelated search. Governance can
    absorb that because it is a policy intersection where an ungoverned scope
    permits; a hard deny cannot. A relative root therefore stays relative and no
    rule keyed on an absolute prefix matches it (see the residual limits).

    LEXICAL ONLY: no ``realpath``, so a symlink into a denied tree is not resolved.
    The resolved sensitive-path keystone remains the layer that does not depend on
    spelling.

    Never raises: this runs inside the permission gate, where an exception is a crash
    rather than a security decision. On any failure the raw value is returned for the
    caller to encode, which cannot forge a field.

    Only a BARE ``~`` (alone or followed by a separator) is expanded, NOT ``~name``,
    and the home directory comes from the ``_SEARCH_HOME_VARS`` environment values
    ONLY — ``os.path.expanduser`` is never called. Both of its lookup paths reach
    the account database through synchronous NSS calls that can stall the gateway
    event loop for seconds on LDAP-backed hosts: ``~name`` via ``pwd.getpwnam``
    (agent-controlled name), and bare ``~`` with ``HOME`` unset via
    ``pwd.getpwuid``. When no home variable is set the ``~`` stays literal — the
    same contract as an unexpanded ``$HOME`` — so the account database is never
    consulted at all.

    The expansion is built by CONCATENATION, never ``os.path.join``: join discards
    every earlier component when a later one is absolute, so ``~//etc`` (remainder
    ``/etc``) would come out as ``/etc`` — the gate would encode a root-scoped target
    while the search itself resolves under the real home, and a home-scoped deny rule
    would miss. Leading separators are stripped from the remainder instead, which is
    exactly what the shells and search tools this gate fronts do with ``~//etc``
    (``$HOME//etc`` == ``$HOME/etc``). The invariant across this whole branch: agent
    text is never dereferenced through the environment or account database beyond the
    fixed HOME spellings and the current user's own home, and once the home prefix is
    chosen nothing later in the string can displace it.

    The twin of :func:`_unc_agents_root`, and it exists for the same reason.
    ``data_home()`` is cheap only on its *default-home* branch: with
    ``KIROCREW_HOME`` set it calls ``_valid_override_home()`` FIRST, on every
    call, and that does ``Path(override).expanduser().resolve()`` --
    filesystem I/O, and on a UNC-shaped override an SMB touch. ``config_dir()``
    memoizes, but that memo sits BEHIND the predicate, so it never covers this.
    Measured at this PR's head: three ``protected_ref_spans()`` calls produced
    three resolves of the override.

    That is the one configuration this gate has to be fast in. A roaming
    profile is exactly when ``KIROCREW_HOME`` points at a share, so the
    per-call resolve lands on the host whose latency the gate promises never to
    depend on -- and :func:`unc_probe_allowed` is reached from
    ``iter_local_refs``, which ``telegram.renderer._rotate_on_length`` runs
    INLINE on the event loop against a documented 7-15 us/KB budget.

    Resolves through :func:`peek_data_home`, NOT :func:`data_home`: this module
    primes the memo at import time, and ``data_home()`` on a first resolution
    delegates to ``config_dir()`` -- ``mkdir`` plus the recovery-breadcrumb
    write. The gate only needs to know WHERE the root is (a path-prefix trust
    check), so importing this module must not create directories or write
    breadcrumbs -- that maintenance belongs to ``ensure_data_home()`` at process
    start. ``peek_data_home()`` applies the SAME override predicate, so reader
    and writer agree on the root, and reads nothing else.

    Memoized on the RAW ``KIROCREW_HOME`` value plus the accessor identity and
    the resolved-home cache the default branch reads -- so an env change, a
    monkeypatched accessor or a reset of the resolution cache all invalidate
    naturally.

    A computation failure memoizes ``None`` (root absent, gate stays total),
    for the reason :func:`_unc_agents_root` gives: the failure being avoided is
    a per-call resolve that can block on an SMB timeout, and the degraded state

    name holding non-UTF-8 bytes, ``surrogatepass`` for an unpaired surrogate in
    a legal NTFS name -- and rejects one it cannot. Both the encoding and the
    error handler are read from ``sys``, which is what makes this the same

# why the read is system infrastructure (the bytes leaving the process never
# reach an LLM/agent surface) rather than LLM/agent-mediated content.

# be persisted returns None), the open is O_NOFOLLOW + fstat, and the target

        ``extra_hooks`` run after the stored ones, through the same matcher, gate
        and spawn, and are never persisted: they belong to the caller (an agent
        spec's own ``hooks`` on a backend that cannot run them, see
        :mod:`kiro_crew.agent_sdk.spec_hooks`), not to this store. They run in
        ``extra_hooks_cwd`` -- the session's workspace, where the harness that
        would otherwise run them runs them -- and their payload's ``cwd`` says so.
        ``tool_match_names``, when given, are every name the call is known by (its
        title, its canonical tool name, its ``@server/tool`` form); a tool matcher
        then matches when it matches any of them. ``tool_name`` stays what the
        payload says.

        For PreToolUse/PostToolUse, matcher filters by tool name. When
        ``extra_hooks_tool_names`` is given, an extra hook's tool matcher is
        compared with those names instead: the tool's identity in the vocabulary
        the extra hooks were written in, which ``tool_name`` (the call's title)
        does not carry. It matches when any name does, and an empty sequence
        leaves only an unscoped (``*``) extra hook matching. The first name is
        also the ``tool_name`` an extra hook's stdin payload reports, so a script
        that branches on it reads the same vocabulary its matcher is written in.
        For AgentSpawn/UserPromptSubmit/Stop, all hooks for that event fire.

        Optional ``subagent_id``, ``parent_session_key``, and ``agent_role`` are
        emitted into the hook_event payload so hook scripts can attribute tool
        calls to the specific agent/session that fired them. Parent contexts
        (dashboard chat, generic LLM helpers) leave them as ``None``.

        For the Stop event, the full ``context`` (the final assistant segment) is
        used for matcher evaluation and echoed to stdin as ``assistant_text``;
        only the ``KIROCREW_HOOK_CONTEXT`` env var is length-capped downstream in
        ``run_script_hook`` (ARG_MAX safety), so a hook keying on the tail of the
        segment reads it from stdin JSON rather than the truncated env var.
