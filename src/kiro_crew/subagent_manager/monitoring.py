    ``spawn_continue`` re-seeds the session map from the run's ``state.json`` to
    resume it after a restart. "No result was captured" therefore under-tells:
    the parent re-spawns from scratch and pays for the same tool calls twice.

    The hint is offered only when the conversation is actually resumable by the
    one rule ``SessionMap.get`` applies before it hands a sid out

    present and the ``{sid}.jsonl`` holding a turn; for any other backend the
    resume itself decides, so the handle is offered and ``spawn_continue``
    refuses typed if the session is gone). A pruned, released or never-started
    kiro-cli conversation is therefore never advertised. Progress rides along so

        The attribution is what makes it sound. With the in-flight tool's real
        ``is_shell`` + command, the consult takes the oracle's shell-child
        branch, which matches a live descendant by CMDLINE and then tracks that
        pid — so the evidence belongs to THIS subagent's own child even when the
        runtime is shared with sibling subagents. That is the distinction an
        earlier whole-subtree attempt could not make: a subtree aggregate is
        dominated by kiro-cli's own background socket/keepalive traffic, so a
        ``sleep``-only subagent read as "working" and was never flagged.

        Returns ``(verdict, evidence)``; any failure degrades to
        ``(VERDICT_UNKNOWN, ...)`` so the caller falls back to idle time.
